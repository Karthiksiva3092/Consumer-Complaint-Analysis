I questioned the man that wrote up the contract for us and of whom I had asked about the cross bars before and he claims he never said the cross bars were included. At this dealership every person that I spoke with deceived us and then passed us on to someone else.

13,2015-07-27,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"This is a new complaint. In the after math of successfully completing a mortgage modification from bank of america stemming from the XXXX 2014 settlement with the Department of Justice, boa voluntarily withdrew the suit filed against me. 
My mortgage statements show or state that I owe a total of {$370.00} in litigation and or litigation management fees. I sent my attorney the mortgage statements that showed this information. My attorney has contacted the law firm, listed on the former suit, a few times asking for proof that these fees can be charged to me and as of this writing no response has been given. 
All the information in the transaction activity of my mortgage statement is concerning to me. I see and understand the transactions concerning the modification but I do n't understand the following fees even though they show that they are paid ( I 'm guessing from the modification terms ) - they are : unapplied funds reversal XXXX ( which I assume went to pay for these successive itemized charges ) Attorney/Trustee fee XXXX '' '' XXXX '' '' XXXX '' '' XXXX separate entries for property inspections at {$15.00} each = XXXXTitle Fee XXXX '' '' XXXXCourt Filing Fee XXXXMailing Fee XXXXRecording Fee XXXXLitigation Management Fee XXXX '' '' XXXX '' '' XXXX '' '' XXXX '' '' XXXXProcess Server XXXXWaive/Adj LateChg XXXX '' '' XXXXUnapplied Funds Posted XXXXUnapplied Funds Reversal -XXXXPayment Posted XXXXI don '' t understand how my account can be charged for any monies/charges stemming from the suit boa filed. boa voluntarily withdrew the suit therefore the court did not state which party was liable for legal fees and for which fees or the total amount the party would be responsible for paying. My attorney and I can not find any wording in the modification that states these fees can be charged and or acceptable fees I have to pay. 
If the XXXX unapplied funds reversal went to pay for above stated paid fees from monies forgiven in the modification then I believe that money should either go toward the mortgage principle amount or returned to the settlement pool from which it came from. 
bank of america 's legal fees should not be paid by me or the mortgage modification forgiveness monies. If they believe they should be reimbursed for any legal fees they should have not withdrawn their suit or file a suit to decide who is responsible for those fees. 
This last bit is more for preemptive measures versus an additional complaint. I am reading many complaints from successful mortgage modification homeowners that two to six months into the permanent mort. mod that boa is claiming missing documents from these homeowners and voiding the mot. mods. I feel this is very worthy of applicable agencies investigation ( s ). I will certainly file various complaints if this does occur with my permanent modification.

The full appraisal of the subject property was performed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX by a fully licensed appraiser, certified to perform appraisals for FHA. The subject property was appraised at {$490000.00}. A copy of the Appraisal Report was submitted to BofA on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The current Principal Balance on the loan is {$340000.00}. That makes LTV below 70 %! In the letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX received from BofA, it estimated the Property Value as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX to be {$470000.00}. The LTV ratio based on BofA 's own Property Value Estimate is below 70.00 %. Furthermore, even if you take the Purchase Price of the Property at the time of purchase in XXXX, of {$430000.00}, the current LTV is still under 80.0 %. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX we send a check for {$450.00} to cover appraisal fee for a second appraisal as Bank demanded. Bank cashed the check immediately and still has not even started process of appraisal. I called back PMI department they said they do n't see payment for appraisal being processed! I filed a complaint with CFSB on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, got a letter from XXXX XXXX, "" customer advocate '' that she is going to resolve the matter by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Nothing happened as of today. I am leaving messages to her phone number XXXX it does not even ring, goes straight to voice message ) she calls me back XXXX days letter when I am not at the phone and leave me a message. There is no way to get a hold of her. I asked for a fax or email to communicate, with no success. Nothing is being done and PMI is still charged.

I called their number, and asked repeatedly what company they were calling from ; what they were calling me in regards to ; what was the name of their company. Their employees refused to answer my questions, instead they just put me on hold and transferred me to another person. Then they would hang up. I called back again, and finally one of their representatives told me the name of their company was Trans World Systems. They did NOT tell me that this was in reference to a debt. They asked for personal information ( my name, address ) but refused to tell me why. Finally, I told the person that I would be filing a complaint with the FTC if they ever called me again. I asked them to confirm that I had told them not to call me, and the person said yes. Many times during my call, I asked them what this was in reference to, and they refused to answer. The only reason I know that they are debt collectors is from Googling the name of their company. I have not been told what debt this is in reference to, so I can not make any judgment about whether it is an actual debt, or a complete scam. They totally ignored their government requirement to tell me that their phone calls were in reference to a debt. In addition, I believe that they are attempting to mislead consumers with their name. It would be easy to confuse their name ( Trans World Systems ) with the legitimate company XXXX XXXX.

Dear .... 
My name is XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX with residence at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX FL XXXX. 
This is my XXXX time trying to have an answer about ; in my opinion is a force of power, not a justice. Here is my history and I look for answer, positive or negative but an answer that convince me that I am wrong. 
I own the Deed of my house but with a lien for a mortgage loan. I stared a Loan Modification with the Loan Servicer on XX/XX/XXXX with a XXXX trial payments, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX 
XX/XX/XXXX, after a XXXX payment was made, I received a Loan Modification Agreement. The Agreement says on Section # XXXX : & lt ; Acknowledgements and Preconditions to Modification. I understand and acknowledge that : A. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE under this Agreement ; B. If prior to the Modification Effective Date as set forth in Section XXXX the Servicer determines that my representations in Section XXXX are no longer true and correct, the Loan Documents will not be modified and this Agreement will terminate. In this event, the Servicer will have all of the rights and remedies provide by the Loan Documents ; andC. I understand that the Loan Documents will not be modified unless and until ( i ) I received from the Servicer a copy of this Agreement signed by the Servicer, and XXXX XXXX ) the Modification Effective Date ( as defined in Section XXXX ) has occurred. I further understand and agree that the Servicer will not be obligated or bound to make any modification of the Loan Documents if I fail to meet any one of the requirements under this Agreement. 
Section XXXX. The Modification. If my representations in Section XXXX continue to be true in all material respects and all preconditions to the modification set forth in Section XXXX have been met, the Loan Documents will automatically become modified XX/XX/XXXX ( the "" Modification Effective Date '' ) and all unpaid late charges that remain unpaid will be waived. The Loan Documents will be modified and the first modified payment will be due on XX/XX/XXXX & gt ; XX/XX/XXXX, when I tried to make the mortgage payment as stipulated on the Loan Agreement, the Servicer told me that they can not accept the payment because the Loan Modification was n't complete yet and the same happen XX/XX/XXXX. After been talking with the Relationship manager about it, he says the same, the Loan Modification was n't complete but I never received a letter from the Servicer explaining that they are behind in the process but the Loan Modification is approved until XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, I do n't exactly remember, when I spoke with the Relationship Manager and he told me that everything is approved XX/XX/XXXX Few days after, I received a Loan Statement showing 2 month behind, date XX/XX/XXXX. When I call, they said that I suppose to make the payments for XXXX and XXXX, I claim that I was n't allow because the modification process was late but they ask me to make those 2 month payments if I would like to have my mortgage up to date, and if not it will be behind those 2 month. I received the executed Modification Agreement the first or second week of XX/XX/XXXX, and it was signed by the Servicer XX/XX/XXXX.

I asked him how he could cancel an arrangement that had been okay for past 3 months and he said that it did n't matter that I needed to setup a new arrangement. At this point in time I told them I would be contacting the government because they made an agreement on recorded lines and are breaking them and making false representations. He explained that collection efforts and calls would continue until I agreed to more than {$25.00} a month because that amount is not acceptable and then said okay in reply to me filing a complaint and hung up. I do not believe this should be allowed or else what is the point of having agreements if they can simply break them twice in one month and then act like I have no choice but to accept a new arrangement at 6 times the original payment amount!

XXXX XXXX XXXX in one of her inquiries remarked, "" Who told you to fill out a new loan modification application?

This is XXXX XXXX, empirical data, that the major ontological principal, at work is that JP Morgan Chase Bank knowingly and willfully committed significant procedural errors in the real-estate acquisition process, to such an extent that the aforementioned JP Morgan Chase Bank, due to their fraud, greed, and negligence has violated numerous principals in the federally regulated field of lending for the purpose of acquiring housing. XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed that she did n't realize that a new loan modification application had been completed. 


XXXX XXXX gave evidence in that particular instance and in prior, that JP Morgan Chase Bank, of which XXXX XXXX XXXX own Executive Office representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX and several others of XXXX XXXX XXXX associates had on several occasions instructed XXXX XXXX to file a new loan modification. They not only told XXXX XXXX to file a new loan modification but they also went as far as sending XXXX XXXX the loan modification application forms and were monitoring the process of the loan which XXXX XXXX sent on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and confirmed received by JP Morgan Chase on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The loan modification was confirmed and received by JP Morgan Chase, and it has been 2 1/2 months and we still have not received any correspondence concerning the status of our application. Dual tracking laws state that we are required to receive a response via writing. This is again creating another dual tracking situation. This shows continued lack of communication within JP Morgan Chase Executive staff and administration that has caused the problems in the very beginning. 

It is again, very disturbing and very evident that our questions and concerns about their protocols, tactics, and business ethics concerning our loan modification continue to be diverted and go unanswered. The responses lack specificity and there is no clear narrative as to what person, what office or what entity committed such actions. There h

My payment was not due until XXXX XXXX and I was calling a month before. I had just made my XX/XX/XXXX payment and did not have that money to make a payment. I indicated I would call back in XX/XX/XXXX to obtain the new amount and set up my payment options.

I been in collections with this company before over the summer and they use tactics such as lying to you. the collections associate XXXX, would take my information tell me I was approved for programs than the day before my bills would be do she would call me and say I was denied and I needed to apply for something else would we take all my information when I could not make payments at that high amount she would make comments such as my co-signers would be litigated my way in wages would be garnished. When I would ask for programs in writing to see the criteria and to see why I did not qualify same thing nothing in writing was ever provided in regards to criteria and programs available.

That means that {$4800.00} + {$2000.00} = {$6800.00} and then star paying the principal? How can a deal like this could be legal? I know that the collection Offices main business is to collect, but taking money away from a person with a {$12000.00} net salary a year? I am going to do my part of the deal, but I am letting you know in advance that I am going to look for legal help and I am going to start sending letter to the Congress, to the newspapers and even to Obama at the White House, to let them know how unfair people with students loans are crushed by the collection offices.

However I will start by saying Commonwealth Financial Systems is a pathetic excuse for a company. The employees that represent this company are the most ignorant and hateful beings I have ever had the displeasure of speaking with! I was appalled by the lack of professionalism they presented. I was not told of the so called "" Mini Miranda '' notice at the beginning of my call when I spoke to a Specific representative this rep was XXXX of the worst and I have her name and reported her which did no good I am sure. Aside from all that when speaking with this specific rep I was so hurt and disgusted by her attitude I asked to be transferred to a manager high than her she REFUSED! stating that she will take care of me I asked multiple times to be transferred she refused every time finally I hung up and just asked to be transferred to someone besides her. On another note I do not owe this debt I have received absolutely nothing in the mail prior to it being sent to collections and the debt is from 2009 in my state of KY the statute of limitations has expired yet they continue to bother me. I also asked for an itemized bill because I wanted validation of the debt before I even think to pay a penny. They "" requested '' it over a month ago and still nothing has been sent to me. I have never in my life been so mistreated by any company! It is my understanding that if you represent a company one would think there would be at least a small amount of respect exchanged by the employees to the consumer. I received nothing but unanswered questions hateful and insulting behavior from the representatives and a clear understanding of who not to be as a human being. I would never speak to any individual or treat any XXXX as they have treated me!

313,2015-06-29,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"We submitted an application for a loan modification to PennyMac. PennyMac denied the application via a letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2015. PennyMac failed to include in its denial letter the name of the investor and the NPV results. Pasted below is the excerpt from my letter to PennyMac. 
PennyMac claims the XXXX following reasons that the application for a loan modification was denied as stated on Exhibit A of PennyMac 's XXXX XXXX, 2015, letter : Capitalized Loan to Value ( LTV ) Excessive Forbearance Housing Expense Ratio Outside of Acceptable Range Insufficient Net Cash FlowPennyMac has failed to provide the total capitalized unpaid principal balance, the value of subject property, the income and debts used in its calculations. These are all data inputs used in calculating NPV ( net present value ). See Home Affordable Modification Program, Base Net Present Value ( NPV ) Mode XXXX Model Documentation here : XXXX See pages XXXX that state the NPV model inputs - these inputs include unpaid principal balance before modification, property valuation, borrower 's total monthly obligations and monthly gross income. As PennyMac is claiming the reasons for denial include the LTV and the inability to come up with an acceptable modified payment and insufficient net cash flow then these values must be disclosed as PennyMac engaged in a net present value calculation. 
As explained in the Comments to 12 C.F.R. 1024 ( d ), if a trial or permanent loan modification is denied because of a net present value calculation, then the denial notice must include all the inputs used in the net present value calculation. 12 C.F.R. 1024, Supp. I, 41 ( d ) cmt. 2. PennyMac 's XXXX XXXX, 2015, letter does not include any inputs it used in this calculation. This is exactly the kind of information called for by RESPA to enable borrowers to make an informed decision about whether they should appeal the servicer 's loss mitigation determination or pursue other options. PennyMac failed to provide it. 

In its XXXX XXXX, 2015, letter PennyMac states "" We may order an appraisal or other forms of valuations to determine the property 's value in the course of reviewing your application. If we do order any valuations in connection with the application in determining whether your loan qualifies for a loan modification, a copy of the valuation ( s ) will be enclosed with this notice, if applicable. '' Clearly the value of the subject was used in reviewing the application as one of the reasons for the denial is due to capitalized loan to value. The value in "" loan to value '' is the valuation of the home yet PennyMac failed to enclose with its letter any valuations of the property. PennyMac representatives disclosed to me that PennyMac had a BPO completed on XXXX XXXX, 2015, that resulted in a value of {$69000.00}. Is that the value that PennyMac utilized in reviewing this application?

347,2015-10-28,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account status,"HI, The problem seems to be the fact that the reports do not show credit reports showing all payments have been made on time, there have been no late payments missed or late for as long as I can remember. 
There was reporting of my lease payments made every month for for the time i have lived here, for some reason that reporting stopped?, I have never been late or missed a payment ever, but the non reporting seems to have affected my score, in the credit report it shows that there were a few missed payments when i purchased my car, this is incorrect, I purchased the car in XXXX 2002 ( new ) car was paid in full in 5yrs, not one payment was missed or late. 
The other accounts in my credit life such as XXXX account, phone bills, all the normal everyday bills that do not get reported i have never missed or been late, but this system does not take any of that into consideration when reporting my score. 
I have taken pride in paying my debts on time, there have been no derogatory reports, no negative anything, but yet the transunion report, and the others continue to show a few missed payments in the car purchase, account is paid in full and closed years ago, no reporting on on time lease payments going on 4 years now, never late, never missed a payment, this reporting just suddenly stopped for some unknown reason. 
I guess you can see i am a bit upset with this reporting system, the errors that are there, have tried to get them corrected by contacting the reporting agency 's, the fact that my banking and savings accounts are above average, because i closed a credit card account because i was not using it, my score went down, and it seems the only way to get it back to where it was is to get another credit card and go into debt, just does not make any sense to me!. 
Thank you for the opportunity to lay this out, really would not have to go through all of this if there was a accurate and efficient way of reporting errors that need to be corrected. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX.

The exact key factors appeared on a disclosure of credit score information XXXX XXXX, 2016. I have written to the credit bureaus disputing these key factors, with one response. Credit bureau asked that I be more specific. I replied that according to the disclosure information no specific accounts were included in these adverse key factors. I can only dispute what was presented to me. I find their comments totally absurd. A review of several credit reports does not reflect these horrendous key factors. 
There are no serious delinquencies. Public Records was a chapter XXXX bankruptcy dismissed and has been removed from XXXX of the XXXX credit reporting agencies. There are no accounts with delinquencies which makes the length of time nonexistence. The time since delinquency is too recent or unknown. This is a bogus comment with no supporting data.

I have been XXXX since XXXX and I have to be sure each month to budget my spending. As far as I was aware my mortgage is {$720.00}, but I have been paying an extra {$20.00} a month because my home insurance went up last year around {$200.00}. My account was drafted {$760.00}. I did not receive an XXXX bill or a letter about my mortgage payment increasing ; therefore, my bank account did not cover my increase payment of the extra {$20.00}. I was charged an overdraft fee of {$38.00}. Today I called my mortgage company, OCWEN to enquire about the new mortgage amount. The OCWEN representative stated it was due to my escrow shortage. I could not believe what he was telling me. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I received a refund check from OCWEN. I called OCWEN before I cashed the check in order to know the reason I was receiving the {$430.00} check. I was told that they had to send me a refund for the overage in my escrow account. I told them that I wanted to be sure due to the ordeal I went through with in XXXX XXXX. They had claimed my payment was late and sent me threatening letters about foreclosure procedures. I had never missed a payment, or been late on my mortgage. I complain through CFPB [ # XXXX ] & OCWEN took the late fees off & did not report a miss payment to the credit bureaus. 
The representative told me TODAY that I should have not cashed that check and I should send it back. They are trying to ruing my credit. I applied for a HARP loan through OCWEN and was denied because the said my nontaxable income was more than enough to pay my bills. They claimed by law they had to add 25 % to my income for qualification purposes. I do not understand how I could have a {$430.00} overage in my escrow on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and evidently XXXX weeks later, I have a {$250.00} escrow shortage. OCWEN did not send me an XXXX XXXX payment statement or a letter stating an escrow shortage..

In XXXX of 2015 I called Navient asking if I could call in my payment two weeks later due to financial issues. The operator that I talked to stated that I could. Nevertheless, my payment showed up late and due to me being in the special program, XXXX late payment backed me up three months ( being enrolled in the program allowed my account to be current, however missing a payment resulted in this 90 day late report, and I am unclear as to why ). My cosigner also got this placed on her report. I am writing because I feel as though this should be removed, specifically from my cosigner who will be needing to apply for a loan soon. I do not want this to mess up her credit, especially since I was given misinformation from the employee at Navient.

I called back and was told that I was in fact eligible and was transferred to a licensed specialist whom proceeded to ask me a series of questions. She determined based on my answers that I was eligible. She asked if she could pull me credit report and I told her I first wanted to know what type of rate and product she could offer me. The representative quoted me rates of "" low to mid 3 % for the same 30 yr fixed product '' based on me telling her my credit score was over XXXX. I was EXTREMELY clear that I only wanted her to pull my credit if those were in fact the rates she could get me. She assured me they were. After waiting on hold for about 30 minutes for her to pull my credit report she returned to the line to tell me that although my credit score was very high the best rate she could get me was 4.15 % which is essentially what I have now. I asked her what had happened to the "" low 3 's '' she was quoting prior and she proceeded to tell me that "" it does n't make sense for you to get that rate you 'd have to pay almost {$20000.00} at closing ''. I then asked if those rates she quoted included paying points which not until after the fact did she stutter and hesitate but did confirm that the rates she originally quoted included points.

Citibank was not sending statements or correspondence regarding this loan. When my daughter called to make a work out because she does not make enough money they denied her request. We made numerous attempts to work with them for a better payment plan with their suggestion. They would have us submit everything then say she was not eligible. We spoke to them in XXXX of 2015 and said we would pay as much as we could each month and hope to consolidate the loans, they said we were NOT in danger of default as money has been paid. Last month we received a letter from a lawyer saying the loan was charged off. I am the cosigner and was never notified or given a chance to bring it current for my daughter. I have contacted them via phone and letter ( see attached ) they have been rude and unwilling to discuss this with me, only stating that a letter was sent. They can not provide any information as to how the letter was sent and why I was n't notified. They only informed us that they do not negotiate with students that live XXXX. I am the cosigner living in the US and they would not assist me but are damaging my credit. I cosigned in good faith and the bank did not notify me of any issues with the loan. 
I have sent letters to Citibank which all went unanswered, when I phoned to inquire I was told there is nothing the bank is willing to do. I have a payment history and have been making payments which I thought were in addition to payments they were receiving which would have reduced the interest. Since Citibank has failed to notify me as the cosigner they did not give me the option to assume the loan as I committed to. I 'm very upset with the lack of response and support. More than XXXX has been paid on this loan, it is not as if this loan was ignored. I should have been notified.

On top of that, they are now demanding a 50 % increase in my mortgage payments, even though I signed a fixed 15 year loan at 6 1/4 %. 
Reason given : I did not pay my mortgage for 5 months, therefore they demand that I open an escrow shortage account at monthly payments of {$750.00} instead {$470.00}, an increase of approx. 50 % in monthly payments. 
I do not want an escrow account, since I have been paying my taxes and insurance myself. 
Nationstar also refuses to refund {$950.00} in overpaid escrow fund charges. 
To put it in a nutshell : Nationstar owes me {$950.00} and I owe them nothing, since I 'm paid up with my mortgage payments.

This happened during a modification of this loan when Citi instructed us to stop paying our mortgage to our loans regular payment address and to instead pay them directly to the modification department for a "" trial '' period before the modification would be approved. I warned at this time from Citi that late payments could "" temporarily '' show up on our credit reports but would fall off after the completion of the loan modification since my wife and I have never missed or been late on a single payment with them ever! This still holds true today, we have never been late on a single payment with them. 

A Citi supervisor instructed me to send them a copy of a report page showing the late payments so they could have them removed. I followed his instruction to the letter and Citi is now absolutely refusing to do the right thing, touting they must report the history as their system shows it. I have relentlessly tried working with them to get this FALSE information removed from mine and my wife 's credit reports to no avail, they refuse to do anything about it. 

My wife and I have worked extremely hard to keep our credit reports in good standing and as such have never been late on any payments to any of our creditors so this is as upsetting to us as it gets. We have been VERY long time customers of Citi so even more frustrating to be wronged to such extent by them! 

I have heard so many horrible stories of Citimortgage pulling stuff like this with other people, but still in shock they would do something like this to their customers. 

I would definitely like to file a complaint about Citimortgage as I ca n't see this even being legal what they have done! If possible I would like to request assistance in getting Citimortgage to do the right thing and have these false late payment remarks removed from both mine and my wife 's credit reports!

We found that the charges related to the utilities are fair and accurate, but we are disputing the charge for carpet replacement. After contacting property management we were instructed to dispute the charges in writing explaining our position on the matter. 
The dispute letter was delivered to property management in person. While waiting for a response from property management, we were contacted by Hunter Warfield via telephone for the purpose of collecting the debt in its entirety. We explained that we were in the process of contesting certain components of the debt with property management and were not really certain as to why a debt collection agency would be reaching out to us. We do not feel as though we are responsible for replacing the carpet as it was left in the same condition in which we received it. We have pictures and a move-in inspection that notes that there were stains on the carpet at the time we took occupancy of the apartment. The carpet was not new when we moved in. This was the point made in our original letter to property management. We were merely informed that a notation on the account would be made. We contacted property management who said it was now out of their hands which we found shocking being that we were waiting on a response from them. They then informed us that they responded to our letter via certified mail, but acknowledged that they had not received notice from the post office that their response had been received. We never received a response from property management by either letter or phone call. Since then, Hunter Warfield has repeatedly phoned for the purpose of collecting the entire debt without formally identifying themselves, sending anything in writing for the purpose of debt validation, or explaining the process of disputing the debt. During every phone call, we 've simply repeated the entire story to each Hunter Warfield associate that has called. During our last exchange with Hunter Warfield, we found the associate to be very rude and condescending as she threatened actions that would have adverse effects on our credit reports. It was then we began to feel harassed and quite stressed about the situation. I have repeatedly called XXXX XXXX at XXXX to open a better line of communication. I was sent to her voicemail only after being hung up on XXXX.

I have verified over the phone with both debt collection agencies that the claims are from XXXX XXXX XXXX and for the SAME CLAIM originally made by XXXX XXXX XXXX. In order to verify this in documentation I have pursued Mutual Management SR seeking documentation on the claim. These are the steps I have taken with Mutual Management SR : 1. I have not received any documentation on the claim from Mutual Management SR, they are required to send me documentation of the details of the claim made. 
2. I called Mutual Management SR home office and spoke to a representative requesting documentation of their claim, verifying my current address. No documentation was sent to me. 
3. I sent a letter ( attached below ) requesting documentation of claim XXXX within 30 days requiring they remove the claim from my credit report if not received. No documentation was sent to me. 
4. After 30 days of the first letter I sent a second letter ( attached below ) again requesting documentation on claim XXXX or to remove the claim from my report. No documentation was sent to me. 
5. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX over the phone and spoke to a representative requesting documentation, I also informed them that another debt collection agency was seeking payment for the same claim and they needed to be contacted. Again no documentation of claim XXXX was ever sent to me. 

The original claim made by XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2010 was that I had not given them proper notice to end my lease ( 60 days ). I gave them a 30 day notice before my lease agreement ended for job transfer to another state. I forfeited my deposit to them for this reason and they still attempted to require of me moneys even though the deposit would cover the extra 30 days rent. I never agreed to their pursuit of extra rent money and thus they sold the claim to XXXX different collection agencies. I have never agreed to this collection claim.

The home is directly on the XXXX and earns an average gross income of approximately {$5500.00} per month ( {$66000.00} per year ). 

My XXXX direct contact, XXXX XXXX, Officer ; XXXX, supervisor XXXX XXXX, initiated an appeal on her own without the consent/collaboration of myself.

XXXX XXXX stated to me that the substantiated XXXX monthly income was not included based on a subjective determination/judgement of an underwriter. Please remember that if you practice subjectivity, you make everything up for debate. 

XXXX please explain to me how gross income, income not affected by expenses, is determined/calculated and why income from a rental property is not included based on a subjective judgement of an underwriter. If you are not using the income, you ca n't use the expense. 

Please explain to me how the RMA handles/classifies/lists/accounts for homes owned, seasonally rented, and used by the owner when not rented. What category does this fall under in the XXXX proprietary capitalization modifications? 

In the current scenario you add all my income other than the seasonal rental income/contracts derived from the property in question and make decisions on my ability to pay the mortgage on that property without including the property income. According to XXXX XXXX this is a subjective judgement by the underwriter and is not a clearly/objectively defined operating procedure. 

Please be transparent and explain the variables used in the XXXX that determines modification or not on internal capitalization modifications. In addition, please explain to me why you would want to claim the process is proprietary and not be open and share it with the clients of which you are here to help.

The aforementioned have violated federal and state law. I want the aforementioned to stop harassing me and to stop collection. I seek that aforementioned not sell or transfer to another the time-barred alleged debt so that others may not harass me over a time-barred alleged debt. Unless the aforementioned complies with my sought relief, I will pursue legal action. 

VIOLATIONS OF LAW : Sections : 1031 ( a ) and 1036 ( a ) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C.

CEASE COMMUNICATION : Pursuant to Section 805 ( c ) of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. Section 1692c, I am writing that, upon closure of this CFPB complaint, I wish the aforementioned, debt collectors, and anyone and anything that not specifically mentioned but may have been, may be presently, or may be future connected or related to any and all of the aforementioned to cease any and all further communication with me.

I received a letter from another Law firm saying that they are collecting a debt for XXXX XXXX. An alleged debt that another law firm called Bowman, Heintz , Boscia & Vician were attempting to collect a few months ago. See case number XXXX of my previous complaint. Seems like the debt was sold to this new law firm called Blatt, Hasenmiller, Leibsker & Moore but this new firm or previous firm will not provide me any evidence that they purchased the debt from the previous law firm and they are now the new owners of this alleged debt. I asked for a copy of an agreement that has my signature and to validate the debt by showing a signed contract with my name that this alleged debt is mine. They have failed to provide me any evidence that they have the right to collect or that I even owe this debt. They provided me a copy of a judgment from the courts but anyone can get a copy of a judgment from public records. Having a copy of a judgement does n't mean that you own the debt and by just saying that the info has been validated does n't mean that it is true. This is all hearsay until we see some type of evidence that I truly owe this alleged debt. I have asked time and time again from the previous law firm and this current law firm to provide me with evidence that this alleged debt is mine. No one has produced a contract or an agreement with my name on it and they are just passing this info around to try to collect money from me. I do not owe XXXX XXXX anything, I do not owe this law firm anything. Not even sure how they come up with the amount they say I owe. I have never signed an agreement with XXXX XXXX and I do not have any contracts or an account with XXXX XXXX. The law firm is just a collection agency that is trying to collect free money. It seems thought that the first law firm gave up because they could not prove that I owe the alleged debt, so they past the case to another law firm which I found out the new firm is in the same building as the first law firm. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IN XXXX. What was their consideration of the payment? what proof they own the debt now? Was this assigned by XXXX XXXX, if so why did XXXX XXXX change lawyers when they already had someone trying to collect the alleged debt from me. This law firm is just another collection agency that is trying to get easy money by sending letters to consumers saying that they owe debt but ca n't proof any of it. This should be against the law. They should be able to provide something showing that the alleged debt belongs to whom. If I said that the alleged debt was paid in full, they would want some time of evidence that shows the debt was paid. I should have the same consideration. I ca n't just write that the alleged debt was paid, I would have to show it was by having a copy of the check, receipt or something in writing that it was paid. The agencies need to show something as well and stop sending letters trying to scare consumers to paying because they say we owe. Please view the letter that was sent to me as well as the letter that I sent for them to validate the debt or show any proof that I owe this debt attached to the complaint.

2. Recent transactions that were charged to my account by American Express, initially as credit ( adjustments ) then as debits. 
I was given the option to pay balances over time by American Express with a credit limit of XXXX. However, I noticed several adjustments on my account in the amounts of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX.

Also, when I manually added up all of my charges and all of my payments ( not taking into account interest ), the aggregate total reflected was less than the amount that appeared on my XX/XX/XXXX statement. 
Please see letters sent to American Express along with corresponding statements.

It is at this time that I will point out the in XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, Equifax et, the courts ruled each and every time that the CRA could n't merely "" Parrot '' information from the creditors and collection agencies ... that they have conduct an independent REASONABLE investigation to ensure the validity of the debt and honesty/integrity of the creditors/CA in question. Sending out a generic form through the XXXX system that does n't even contain my reasons for the dispute is not reasonable. 

If you do n't initiate an investigation regarding my dispute, as it is my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I will have to take legal action to protect my credit rating and myself. Which I 'm sure you are aware each violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows damages of {$1000.00} should this matter ends up in court. 
I look forward to an expedite resolution of this matter Thank you.

681,2015-08-26,Mortgage,Other mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"Due to unforseen business problems associated with the downturn in XXXX, I lost a business where I had personal guarantees that caused me to seek personal Bankruptcy in late XXXX through XXXX. At the time I owned XXXX homes with mortgages with XXXX different financial institutions. XXXX I lost through the bankruptcy, but the other I kept which is the XXXX I am writing about. As part of the process, I went through the HAMP ( Home Affordable Modification Program ) which resulted in a loan modification. The trial period was completed in XXXX and a loan modification was completed. I have made all payments fully and on time since the trial period began and continuing with a loan modification through today - additionally earning "" pay for performance '' incentives from the program each month eligible. 

A large part of rebuilding my credit is the new history of on-time payments. As such it is important that all of my credit history be available. My mortgage holder refuses to acknowledge and report my mortgage performance to the credit bureaus, citing my bankruptcy as the reason they do not have to report it. They indicated that I did not "" reconfirm '' in the Bankruptcy proceedings that I intended to keep the mortgage, although I acknowledged in my initial filing that it was my intent, went through the HAMP program during the Bankruptcy, signed new mortgage modification paperwork, and have made all payments on time since completing the trial period to qualify. Additionally, since they will not report anything, my old mortgage shows on my credit reports as in Bankruptcy without showing resolution. 

The Bank was not asked, nor did they offer, to reduce the principle amount owed on the loan. While the interest rate on the loan is less than the previous amount on the original mortgage, they will be whole once the note is paid off. 

I previously contacted the Bank on more than XXXX occasion, seeking to have payment information reported to the credit agencies. The farthest I have gotten was being referred to the Bankruptcy department where I was told that since I have not "" reconfirmed '' my intent during the Bankruptcy they were under no obligation to report my information. My only option was to reopen my Bankruptcy ( at my cost ) to reconfirm the mortgage. 

While others did suffer because of my Bankruptcy, as well as me personally, this particular institution did not. The whole intent of Bankruptcy is to help people get out of overwhelming debt and get back on the right track to financial independence. I am working very hard to resurrect my credit rating which for many years was in the high XXXX. But that is made difficult by the fact that the Bank will not report my credit information. I can not accept that this Bank has the right to hold back such information since I have a modified loan in good standing.

721,2015-10-06,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"To Whom It May Concern, I am filing this complaint because Select Portfolio Servicing XXXX Inc., hereinafter referred to as SPS, has violated the Federal Truth In Lending Act. I have filed other complaints alleging other violations, however, this is the first I have filed a complaint against them for violating the clear and concise laws that make up the Federal Truth in Lending Act, hereinafter referred to as TILA. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I mailed SPS, a notice of rescission. SPS receive my notice of rescission on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Under TILA, the rescission is self-enforcing and automatically extinguishes the deed of trust and the promissory note by OPERATION OF LAW. The act has also noted that delivering notification to the entity to which the consumer has been directed to send payments constitutes delivery to the creditor or the assignee. Upon receipt of the rescission, they ( SPS and/or the "" creditor '' ) were to take specific and mandatory steps within twenty ( 20 ) calendar days of receipt of the notice of rescission. The Act makes no distinction between the right to rescind in 3 days or extended as neither cases nor statute gives the courts equitable discretion to alter TILA 's substantive provisions. This matter was strongly supported by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the recent Supreme Court Ruling XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX that was decided on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Pursuant to the Act, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( b ), if SPS did not agree with my right to rescind or felt that I was not entitled to a right to rescind, they, as a "" creditor '', were suppose to file a declaratory lawsuit against me to challenge the notice of rescission. They failed to take such action. Since they have failed to take any action within the statutory 20 calendar days, they have forever waived any and all defenses to the rescission. They have also failed to take the necessary steps to provide me with a reconveyance releasing the deed of trust and tender all monies paid in connection with my debt obligation to me. Although I am not looking for any monetary awards, I am entitled to a reconveyance of the deed of trust. SPS has sent me a couple of letters in response to my notice of rescission denying my right to rescind, however, the security interest is void and of no legal effect irrespective of whether they and/or the "" creditor '' makes any affirmative response to the notice. There is no provision under TILA that allows them the right or authority to grant or deny my notice of rescission. If they disputed it, they had 20 calendar days to file a lawsuit against me and they have failed to do so. By operation of law, any interest SPS and/or the "" creditor '' had was automatically negated regardless of its status and whether or not it was recorded or perfected. SPS is attempting to foreclosure on a deed of trust that has been canceled and is no longer a legal instrument. Since they have failed to abide by the mandatory acts under TILA, I am under no further obligation to SPS and/or the "" creditor ''. For one, they have failed to abide by the statutory 20 day window period. XXXX, they are unable to establish that they are the true "" creditor '' of my debt obligation. Due to the fact that the deed of trust has been canceled, they ( SPS and/or the "" creditor '' ) are unable to use the deed of trust, promissory note, or any assignments to establish ownership. They must provide proof they actually lent me the funds. This is proof they do not possess and once again failed to file a lawsuit within 20 days. I felt the need to file this complaint because I am appalled and disgusted by SPS 's blatant disregard for the law. It appears they feel they have the right to do whatever they wish without any consequences of their actions. It is my belief that these laws were implemented to protect us and they should not be allowed to ignore and disregard them

Recently, I have been trying to pay my credit cards off/down to increase my XXXX score. On or about XXXX XXXX, I paid the {$800.00} balance on my home depot card down to {$500.00}, which would be 50 % of the {$1000.00} limit. Immediately after crediting the payment, without notice or justification, Citibank lowered my credit limit from {$1000.00} to {$700.00}. This action immediately changed my credit utilization from 50 % to over 80 %. It is a well known verifiable fact that credit balances over 50 % have an negative impact on credit scores. CITIBANK CLAIMS THAT A RECENT REVIEW SHOWS CERTAIN ITEMS -- those items have been on my credit report for several years, even prior to when I opened my Citibank/HD card. Citibank knew of these credit items before even opening my account. Citibank gives a fake reason, claiming credit issues that it already knew about, that already existed when they opened the account and now claims that suddenly, now they matter. Citibank, and other credit cards, intentionally lower credit limits for the express malicious purpose of keeping lower income/credit persons from improving/increasing their credit score. Even if this is not the express purpose, it has the same impact. Credit companies should be expressly prohibited from lowering a credit limit that has never been late and never gone over the credit limit unless certain stringent standards are applied. Otherwise, credit companies can continue to maliciously manipulate credit scrores, thereby continuing to limit credit opportunities to high cost, low credit cards. The federal policy has been to LOOSEN credit available to consumers. Allowing credit companies to maliciously lower credit limits after a payoff allows credit companies to malicously manipulate credit scores.

870,2016-02-04,Prepaid card,Other special purpose card,"Managing, opening, or closing account",,"First. let me state that I never wanted this prepaid card. I apparently had a credit at my doctor 's office and that doctor 's practice ( XXXX ) apparently had a deal with BofA to provide refunds by issuing a prepaid card. The card came out of the XXXX unactivated for a long time because I really had no idea what it was. Even the emailed statements ( they must have gotten my email through the doctor 's office ) looked like spam ( labeled "" Consumer Refunds and Pmts '' with no mention of either the bank or the doctors - that 's not a link I would click on as it looked like phishing ). 

I did finally figure out it was linked to the doctor and activated the card to pay a co-pay, but there have been issues using the card, so I called to try to cancel it and get the balance back. On the first call, the agent put me on hold for a while, the told me she was transferring me to management. Instead I was disconnected. I called back and the agent was somewhat more helpful ; she also put me on hold for a while, but did come back and appeared to be about to process the closure. She informed me that there would be a {$5.00} fee to send me a check and implied that was the only alternative, even though I asked for others. I protested that I should not have to pay to receive my money on an account I never asked for. She again put me on hold, then came back and confirmed that there would be a {$5.00} fee. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold for quite a while, with the agent checking in periodically. She finally came back and said all the supervisors were busy and rather than keep my holding, they could call me back. I asked for a call back within an hour. That hour passed, so I called back. I did notice that my balance had been diminished by {$2.00} from my original call. This third agent was at least somewhat helpful in that he told me that there as a {$1.00} fee per call ( the 2nd agent did not tell me this when I told her I would be calling back if I had not heard from them in an hour ) .He also told me that I could close my account without a fee by going to a BofA location. There is not one near me. I again asked to speak to a supervisor to now ask for the {$3.00} call fees to be credited in addition to the {$5.00} check fee. The supervisor, XXXX XXXX, informed me that he had already closed my account with no credits for the fees, claiming that that was what the agent made clear I wanted and that I had agreed to the fees. He said that it could not be undone at this point. I had never agreed to the fees and that was precisely why I asked to speak to a supervisor! He said that he would submit my request to the Debit Card management, and it would be up to them if any of my requests were honored, but because the account was now closed it was out of his hands. 
This is a scam. I should not be paying to get my money on a card that I never wanted. The way the agents handled this guaranteed that they would maximize their fees. This is exactly the type of deceitful and evasive behavior that gives banks a bad name.

962,2015-11-01,Credit card,,Other,,"Continued security issues caused by inappropriate policy promoting identity theft within the company. ( First reported XXXX/XXXX/15 ; problem still exists ). On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I called Sears Mastercard because XXXX my card had been declined by Sears even though the account is in good standing. The CSR asked for my "" personal password '' and even though I know this is illegal & I addressed this issue back on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I went ahead & complied with the request. I was then advised by the CSR the password I gave was incorrect ( it was not incorrect ) & that I should be giving the name of my first pet. Immediately, I realized Sears had not done anything to address my complaint dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 as they were still practicing a policy which jeopardizes the security of their customers accounts by asking inappropriately for a personal password when what they really want to know is the "" Secret Question '' answer. The CSR 's are not asking the questions appropriately. I advised the CSR of this & was told this is the script they are told to go by. Yes, this happened in XXXX 2015 as well. I advised the CSR to please mark the account that I am officially complaining for the second time this year about their policy, because now I complied with their request to reveal my password only to be told that it was not what they wanted to know. What that means is a ) I now have to change my password ; b ) they never fixed the problem ; c ) they are promoting identity theft ; d ) they are not securing my account, but instead are jeopardizing it ; and, e ) Sears is proving it can not be trusted to protect the accounts of its customers. Since this has happened before, this has to be taken seriously, because their Customer Service department is not listening or taking initiative to solve the problem. Therefore, I am taking serious action. If this issue is not resolved I will take this to the media and advocate a large scale investigation of this banking institution for potential fraud against it 's customers. It is very clear to me that Sears does not take security seriously. They might as well stop trying to say that they do, because they are not doing anything to help the situation. As it turns out my account should never have been flagged for potential fraud. They were only harassing me. Ultimately, I am glad it happened, because it allowed me the opportunity to catch them in the act of just how under-protective of my account they are. I can not believe they would ask for a password knowing that a Customer can actually give them the password trusting them to handle the situation appropriately. Then when you give them the password, they reveal they did n't want the password ; they wanted the secret question. Again, this is XXXX totally different things. Unacceptable. Seven months has passed since this was first reported. Nothing has changed.

Everything was going fine. I had not overdrawn my account or did anything that I know of that was wrong. I was in a car accident and received an {$8000.00} check from an insurance company, which I deposited into my account. Part of this money was to go back to my parents to pay medical bills and other costs relating to my accident. The bank said there would be a 10 day hold on the check after which I would have access to it. The next day I tried to log on to online banking and was unable to do so because my password would not work. I called the bank and they said that they closed my account. They would not give me anymore information. That day I went into my bank and talked to a live person, who said the same thing, which was they could n't tell me why. I was concerned about the {$8000.00} deposit I had just made and the banker reassured me that they would be mailing me a cashier 's check for the money that was in my account in 10 days. That has not happened. My mother and I called Chase again asking about my money that they have been holding for over 2 weeks and also for an explanation as to why they closed my account. They still did not have any information or would not tell us anything. My parents are being harrassed by XXXX different medical facilities who are demanding payment from my accident. They can not pay them until I get MY money back from Chase. Can this possibly be legal? How can it take so long for them to give me my money back. I should have gotten it back the minute they closed my account. I ca n't afford an attorney but I need some help from someone who knows this kind of thing. The car accident I was in was not my fault. I was banged up pretty bad but the worst part was my car was totaled. I had it for one year and had been fixing it up the whole time. The car was finally perfect and I got to enjoy it for 8 months before a bad driver smashed it up. I was very stressed and sad for 2 months. I finally got some money for my "" inconvenience '' from the other insurance company, which made me happy. I deposited this into my Chase account. After paying my medical bills, I was going to get to keep the rest of the money. I thought I would now be able to put the memories of my bad car accident behind me and move on. But, Chase Bank is preventing me from doing just that. Chase Bank is now causing me and my family a lot of stress all over again. I talked to another banker where I opened my new account and asked them how this could happen. They said usually there are XXXX reasons a bank will close someone 's account. Fraud or not getting along with the customer. I certainly have n't committed any fraud and I have never set foot into Chase Bank except for the day XXXX opened my account several months ago and again several weeks ago to inquire about my account getting closed. So, I never interacted with anyone that could say they found me hard to get along with. Please check into this for me.

I am a XXXX year old, XXXX year retiree from the XXXX who has been constantly threatened for my home since 2006, when XXXX went bankrupt and signed the deed to my home over to me. Since that time I have been switched from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX to XXXX to XXXX to SN Servicing every year paying from {$2700.00} a month to {$1000.00}. I honestly believed that my house was deeded over to me in the XXXX XXXX bankruptcy and I made a refinance on a home that was paid off and in my name. ( That was XXXX XXXX and they immediately went out of business ). After several years of showing evidence to lawyers and judges and paying insurmountable court costs, I have grown weary. Especially when I have spent over $ XXXX in attorney fees to succumb to a loan modification which made me pay court costs to the loan servicers of over $ XXXX, with a balloon of $ XXXX tacked on the end of the loan ( which will come at a time when I will probably be unable to acquire a loan for that amount ). Not even a year after the loan modification was granted, the Servicer, XXXX XXXX ), gave me less than a month to pay over $ XXXX because of an increase in my property value which made my homeowners insurance go up. I paid XXXX the money even though I had no forewarning to enable me to save up the payment, ( which I sacrificed out of my medical bills - you see, I am XXXX ), and they still turned me over to the credit bureau as having not paying my mortgage - which I did pay! And, to top that off, I had to increase my current monthly payment by almost a XXXX when the XXXX did not give me an increase on the cost of living. In fact, my income was decreased by almost XXXX.! - see attached. These people have done everything you could imagine to chisel money out of me and to get me to move out of my house so that I would be desolate, in spite of the fact that they swap me from Servicer to Servicer only to tangle the web and complicate things that lead to the fact that they really did n't own my home in the first place. 
Not only that but to add insult to injury, I am have been relentlessly denied from getting a decent loan modification. I was denied twice with XXXX and now also with HAMP - Making home affordable, even after my income got cut by almost $ XXXX, ( XXXX XXXX dollars per week ). See attached. 
I 'm begging you for help before I become another statistic of a XXXX woman, who worked and served all her life for the XXXX and when it came time for the XXXX to come to her aide, she lost her house due to legalized corruption. Please contact me for any reason. If you do not help me, my whole life 's work will have been literally for nothing. The reason why I believe that they keep refusing me getting a Making Home Affordable loan is because they do n't have the paperwork to prove that they legitimately own the house in the first place. All they got is a judge from XXXX Georgia, XXXX XXXX, who is a well known XXXX XXXX owner to write a fake deed which the records will prove that what I am saying is true. Please solve my situation by deeming me my house backto me or make it possible for me to get a Making Home Affordable loan before it 's too late. Respectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX

IT IS NOT BECAUSE SPS AUTODRAFTED ME THAT I INCURRED BANK FEES, IT IS BECAUSE SPS AUTODRAFTED FOR A CONSIDERABLY HIGHER AMOUNT AND ALSO REQUESTED THAT I COMPLETE AUTODRAFT PAPERWORK TO REINSTITUTE AUTODRAFTS AND MAKE CHECK PAYMENTS IN THE INTERIM TO ENSURE MY ACCOUNTS REMAINED CURRENT, TO WHICH I WAS OVERCHARGED AND INCURRED BANK FEES OF {$110.00} FOR DUPLICATE CHECK PAYMENTS ( AS I WAS NOT AWARE THAT SPS WAS CONTINUING WITH MY ORIGINAL AUTODRAFT SET-UP WHEN MY ACCOUNTS ORIGINALLY TRANSFERRED TO THEM IN XXXX ).

COLLECTION BUREAU OF THE HUDSON VALLEY. 
In XXXX 2007 i been punched in the mouth by my sibling & needed stitches. My son was going to drive me to the ER when the ambulance showed up-which i did n't call. i refused their services-as i had only had MEDICARE @ the time & ambulance did nothing for me. 
I was repeatedly sent a bill in which Medicare had paid part of it but they still wanted {$150.00}. 
I suffered a XXXX in XXXX of 2007 & was in XXXX for 3 months. Of course the bills piled up before i was even discharged. i did have a tidy amount of $ in the bank & though i was XXXXmy son would sit me up for an hour a day to make payments by credit card. I paid everyone a little something. 
Please remember i was hospitalized for 4 months. 
These "" people '' CBHV came into my life again & would call all hours-not following the law. But as i was so badly injured-i never thought to report them. This had nothing to do w/the XXXX ambulance bill. 
I paid them off just to get rid of their "" guerilla tactics '' as i was a very sick woman. 
Now keep in mind-my XXXX score is over XXXX! What they had done w/the original {$150.00} charge is kept changing the date of service SO IT WOULD REMAIN ON MY CREDIT REPORTS even after 7 years-in which it is SUPPOSED TO BE REMOVED. 
Now on to the current charges. After spending {$50000.00} -all the money to my name-i then applied for MEDICAID IN NYS. 
So this current charge when i was seen at XXXX XXXX Hospital, i received a bill for {$25.00}. I called billing & gave them my MEDICAID # and this was supposed to clear this charge. OR SO I WAS TOLD of {$25.00}. 
i just received a COLLECTION NOTICE from this corrupt collection agency in which it is charging me {$47.00} for an original bill of {$25.00} -again- i thought ( and was told IT was taken care of ) as due to my incredibly LOW INCOME from XXXX ; i would have qualified for the Charity Grant! 
so CBHV not only keeps reporting a {$150.00} by changing the date of service TO KEEP IT ON MY CREDIT HISTORY which obviously is not effecting it & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; IF MY XXXX IS OVER XXXX! but what THEY ARE DOING IS ILLEGAL. 
AND NOW THIS ERRONEOUS CHARGE from {$25.00} to {$47.00}. XXXX! 
I did write to them & tell them not only am i DISPUTING THIS CHARGE but knowing "" their '' falsified reporting tactics-was reporting to you. 
I receive after paying MEDICARE & my MEDICAID SPENDOWN-ANOTHER ISSUE-which they are continually harassing me telling me my medical receipts are not applicable to my SPENDOWN which is incorrect as i know WHAT IS & IS N'T. 
Anyway-after paying {$100.00}? to MEDICARE & A SPENDOWN OF {$64.00} A MONTH-i am trying to live on {$830.00} a month! 
AND AS A HOMEOWNER-I PAY LAND & SCHOOL TAXES which i pay for ambulance services right in my TAX BILL! 
yes, i have REPORTED various issues here. 
But my MAIN COMPLAINT NOW IS W/ C.B.H.V who i do n't owe this money to. Certainly NOT their "" arbitrary '' charge of {$47.00}! 
AND THEIR CONTINUAL CHANGING THE DATE OF SERVICE FROM 2007 AND REPORTING TO XXXX ; XXXX XXXX ; XXXX ... 
IF I DID N'T PAY MY BILLS WHY WOULD MY FICO SCORE BE SO HIGH? and due to trying to maintain a home on {$830.00} a month i live on CREDIT CARDS so my score is exceptionally HIGH. 
I AM NOT PAYING THEM FOR THEIR LIES. AND THE WAY THEY "" threatened me in the past '' when i could n't even go to bathroom by myself.

They initially told me that it would be {$600.00} on top of my garnishment to get out of default, an amount I could not afford. 5 months later that amount dropped to {$160.00}, which made no sense. 

When I asked if I had any recourse, if there was any XXXX I could go to to dispute this, they blatantly told me no, I could not appeal. 

Had they quoted a manageable number to begin with, I would be out of the garnishment and would have avoided XXXX I have made this year. 

I was not getting any of their communications -- including the ones warning me of the garnishment. I had to tell them XXXX times that my address had changed. 

Two days ago I asked if they could delay my payment 4 days. They agreed. I recorded the phone call as proof. It came out of my bank account as scheduled anyway. This will result in all kinds of fees.

I purchased my car in XXXX of 2013 and I have felt in the dark since I made my first car payment. I sent it to the address on my contract, and was later told by Wells Fargo Dealership that it went to a non-existent address. That started my late payment fees. 
I wrote a letter of hardship last year to Wells Fargo telling them that I was taking care of my XXXX year old mother, and having a difficult time financially. I need the car when I transport my mother to medical appointments or if she has an emergency. I requested their help with this loan by giving me full disclosure regarding my financial history with them, my options for refinance and lowering my interest, and/or lowered payments due to hardship. 
I recently sent the bank a check from my car insurance company for {$3000.00} to try and help me catch up with this loan. The check was made out to Wells Fargo Dealership and myself. I received the check for car repairs, but my family is helping me fix the car. When I sent the check, I asked for a payment history again. I asked for help with the loan. Wells Fargo Dealership has not responded to me. 
When I talked with representatives in the President 's office, I complained that the loan officers were rude on the telephone, being threatening, harassing, calling every day, and I requested them not to call me. I requested contact by e-mail but that was denied due to procedure. I have requested full disclosure and correspondence by snail mail, but that has also been denied to me. I feel frustrated, like I have been in a no/win situation since the beginning of this loan.

1257,2015-08-13,Mortgage,VA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"My husband was laid off of his job in XX/XX/XXXX and we were able to maintain our mortgage payments until XX/XX/XXXX. We applied for the home affordable mortgage ( HAMP ) program with our current servicer, Carrington Mortgage, on XX/XX/XXXX. We received a non-approval notice from them dated XXXX. We requested information about applying for a short sale under the home affordable foreclosure alternatives ( HAFA ) program on XX/XX/XXXX. We submitted all the required documents and our home listing with the realtor on XX/XX/XXXX to the servicer. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we received a notification from the servicer that the initial package for the short sale was completed and we should receive an approval or denial response within 45 days. During this time, the home was been shown to potential buyers and on XX/XX/XXXX we received an offer from a buyer and signed the paperwork to move the process forward for selling the home. The servicer was notified of the offer. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, the servicer sent a vendor to the home and he destroyed the lock casings on the front and back doors, destroyed the lockbox and replaced ( rekeyed ) the lock on the door leading to the deck. The doors to the basement were left wide open and the home was subjected to vandalism and our household property was subjected to being taken by thiefs. No trespassing signs were placed on the property courtesy of Carrington Mortgage. Therefore we were locked out of home and unable to be on the property, which still contained our furniture and personal property and prevented the potential buyer ( s ) from inspecting the home. We spent a lot of time preparing and maintaining the home and grounds for the sale, but we were no longer allowed an the property even the property was not foreclosed. We felt our rights had been violated by the servicer. 
We contacted Carrington on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire as to why the property was locked up and basement doors left open with a pending offer on the table. On XX/XX/XXXX we were told they would send us a set of keys to the new lock. We resubmitted another HAFA package ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) due to numerous threats by Carrington to foreclose on the property even though we had complied with everything requested of us to prevent a foreclosure. On XX/XX/XXXX we received a set of keys ( XXXX ) from the servicer stating XXXX of them would open the lock on the door leading to the deck. We went to the home ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and discovered the front door wide open and the basement doors remained opened. None of the keys fit any locks to the home. We went inside the home and found some damage to all the exterior locks, trash left inside the home and window treatments destroyed. We locked up the home to prevent further damage and prevent our personal property from being stolen ( but this also prevented us from reentering the home and the buyer from inspecting the home because we did n't have keys to the rekeyed locks ). I contacted the servicer on XX/XX/XXXX and informed the representative about the keys not fitting the locks and was told someone from home retention would call me the next day ( I left my contact number ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Carrington again to report the issue with the keys and was finally connected to XXXX XXXX in home retention. I explained the situation to her and was promised that a new set of keys would be sent overnight to me. This has been a very stressful, unpleasant and inconvenient experience for me and my family. Carrington failed to properly communicate ( even when I provided our contact information to them ) any of this with us or the VA, which is the holder of our mortgage. They mishandled this matter by taking possession of the home without properly notifying us of their decision on our initial completed HAFA short sale package or pursuing foreclosure proceedings, as required by Georgia law.

Now I 'm not an accountant, but it seems that it 's illegal to reverse payments and have them posted months later without proper credit for the interest.

I no longer could make my mortgage payment. I continued working with the lender ( Specialized Loan Services ) on trying to get a modification. I had to submit my RMA at least XXXX different times along with fresh documents because my income would change or the old documents would expire. We did this for approximately 2 + years when I finally won my claim and was medically retired and a week later I was hired full time as a XXXX. I then submitted another RMA and documents in the fall of XX/XX/XXXX. There were a few hangups and more documents needed to be refreshed, but finally on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with them and was assured that all my documents were in and my modification was at underwriting and there would be a decision with 30 days, I believe. I was told that there was no sale date but the house was in foreclosure. On XX/XX/XXXX, I took my family for a much needed vacation to Hawaii. We were in Hawaii for 9 days and returned on the XXXX of XXXX. Just prior to returning home, my friend notified me that he went by the house and there was a notice on the door stating that there was a sale date for foreclosure of XX/XX/XXXX. At no time was I notified that the loan modification was denied. I received no phone calls between XXXX XXXX and the time I got home on the XXXX, which I thought was odd because they called me every 5-7 days like clockwork. I call the mortgage company and spoke with a representative and asked what was going on. They stated that our modification was denied on or around the XXXX of XXXX and that I was notified via XXXX. I never received anything in writing stating any such thing. I then asked the rep to look back into her computer to see the XXXX XXXX conversation, which she did and noted that I was indeed told that my documents were all in and that it was at underwriting. She then went on to say that they denied it because I did not have all my documents in. They needed a profit and Loss for a pool cleaning company I had prior. I had notified them earlier about no longer owning the pool service and prior to XXXX XXXX was told to send something in writing explaining that I no longer owned it. I had emailed in the letter explaining why I no longer needed to send in the P & L and later told all my doc 's were in. When I told the representative that they already had the letter, she noted it in the computer and said something to the effect "" Oh my XXXX, I 'm so sorry. I do n't know what the problem is then. She told me there was nothing I could do that the sale date was set. I then spoke to a real estate buddy of mine and he suggested I give him power to talk on my behalf and we try to stop the foreclosure by submitting a short sale. Needless to say we were not able to stop the sale of my home for 15 years. It was sold out from under me, the whole time I thought I had a loan modification in the works. My wife and I not knowing what to do, panicked and thought we would be kicked out of our house and have no place to live, found a place to rent and took "" Cash for Keys '' from the "" Investment Group '' that bought my home. It 's been 2 months and I 'm still spinning as to how this could happen. I 've had numerous people tell me they violated Dodd-Frank laws etc. This was just an unbelievable experience. After working with them for so long and then finally getting financially sound where I could actually afford to pay my mortgage or work something out, they put me on a wild goose chase then stole my home out from under me! I 've contacted attorneys, but am a little leery of diving into that mess. Another buddy of mine told me to contact your website and file a complaint.

XXXX, GA XXXX XXXX : Pending Lawsuit FCRA Violations Once Demand For Payment Is Received Have Your Corporate Counsel Contact Me By Phone To Verify Receipt To Whom It May Concern : This letter is in reference to the countless attempts I have made to resolve incorrect information on my credit report. I have had several accounts and inquires opened fraudulently as a result of a well documented pattern of Identity Theft. Yet every time I have attempted to dispute said information I am met with the same response "" Inquires are a factual record of data ... '' This letter I hope shall put an end to any discrepancy we may have both now and in the future. For starters lets clarify FCRA section 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy states : "" Subject to subsection ( f ) of this section, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. '' Now when your company is notified of a dispute you are required by law as seen above you are obligated as a Consumer Reporting Agency to conduct a full and complete investigation. By merely responding and stating inquires are a factual record of data is not doing so. To clarify my point I will cite case law XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - Court of Appeals, XXXX Circuit XX/XX/XXXX : '' The key term at issue here, "" investigation, '' is defined as "" [ a ] detailed inquiry or systematic examination. '' XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) ; see XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ( defining "" investigation '' as "" a searching inquiry '' ). Thus, the plain meaning of "" investigation '' clearly requires some degree of careful inquiry by creditors. Further, XXXX ( b ) ( XXXX ) ( A ) uses the term "" investigation '' in the context of articulating a creditor 's duties in the consumer dispute process outlined by the FCRA. It would make little sense to conclude that, in XXXX creating a system intended to give consumers a means to dispute -- and, ultimately, correct -- inaccurate information on their credit reports, Congress used the term "" investigation '' to include superficial, un reasonable inquiries by creditors. XXXX. XXXX v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ( interpreting analogous statute governing reinvestigations of consumer disputes by credit reporting agencies to require reasonable investigations ) ; XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ( same ). We therefore hold that 1681s-2 ( b ) ( 1 ) requires creditors, after receiving notice of a consumer dispute from a credit reporting agency, to conduct a reasonable investigation of their records to determine whether the disputed information can be verified. '' At this point your companies failure to comply with the FCRA has caused me significant and undue financial harm as a result I will be filing a lawsuit for {$100000.00} to include damages for me being unable to obtain my XXXX XXXX XXXX as a result of your companies failure amongst other things. Unles we can come to a resonable resolution as far as the removal of the accounts/inquires within 14 calendar days from the date of receipt of this letter.

1407,2016-04-20,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"A loan was supposed to be placed in in-school deferment and was not, despite assurances from Navient that the loan qualified. I contacted Navient both through their online form submission system, and via phone call prior to or shortly after enrolling in my final classes for graduation XX/XX/2015. ( In school period was XXXX 2015 through XXXX 2015 ). It was then reported delinquent to credit bureaus and has destroyed my otherwise good credit. I have a long history with student loans through XXXX XXXX / Navient and have had a great record of payment. I have attempted getting this resolved through Navient and have been told incorrect information, had the phone call disconnected, not received return phone calls or emails, and have had a dispute outstanding with them for over two months. Most recently I was transferred to work the dispute with their customer advocacy team and have experienced the same slow and lacking communication, no follow up on their promised deliverables or timeframe, and a complete misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the initial dispute I filed with them. This is causing extreme financial hardship as I have sold my home and am unable to qualify for a new mortgage because of the incorrect delinquent reportings on the student loan accounts. It has also caused financial hardship to the co-signers on those student loans. In addition to the in-school deferment issue, there was also an issue where several requests for due-date changes were never applied to the account thus resulting in additional delinquency reportings despite my best efforts to keep the account current. When the account was transitioned from XXXX XXXX to Navient is when all of the issues began occurring. Nearly every phone call I attempted to make to Navient at the start of the issues was transferred several times, often the call was disconnected, and I was provided incorrect assurances in several instances. I have never experienced a company so misleading and difficult to work with, and have never experienced so many technical and phone system issues. It is terrifying that they are in the student loan business. They have destroyed my credit, and I will be without a home and with no means of getting a loan in three weeks because of their inaccurate information and lack of responsive and responsibility in handling the situation.

1413,2015-09-11,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Information is not mine,"I am the victim of identity theft and evidently that is humorous to Early Warning LLC, specifically said "" XXXX XXXX, '' purported supervisor. I have exhausted innumerable hours correcting the impact of my identity being stolen years ago. It appears to be a never-ending effort to correct, prevent, and protect my public and private records. I have been able to get nearly all cleared up. I know for a fact that I had NO derogatory records as of XXXX/XXXX/2015 with XXXX Early Warning LLC. I have a copy of my XXXX report, and Early Warning LLC confirmed again that there were NO derogatory records on my report. In fact, they confirmed to the bank that I have NO records at all reported. When opening a personal checking account, I was told by the banker that I had a report from XXXX XXXX XXXX, reported XXXX. When making further inquiry into the inaccurate record, it was found that a TOTALLY different social security number appears on this record, with my other identifying information. I 'm sick of this to say the very least. The banker called the Early Warning department that speaks directly with banks, and Early Warning LLC communicated directly to the banker that as of XXXX/XXXX/2015 there were NO records at all that appeared on my consumer report. They further stated that they DID NOT provide this XXXX XXXX XXXX record to Deluxe Detect. When speaking with XXXX XXXX, the banker was told that they received the record from Early Warning LLC. This is just plain blatant disregard for FCRA and the accuracy of reports, especially for victims of identity theft. Early Warning LLC then advised the bank that they would forward verification directly to them to show NO records. I was told by the banker to return on today to sign my signature card for the opening of my account. When returning to the bank, instead the banker advised she 'd received nothing from Early Warning. I immediately called back to Early Warning LLC. The initial rep told me that the XXXX XXXX XXXX record had been ADDED to my report after they spoke with XXXX XXXX on Wednesday. I was completely taken aback that they would ADD a clearly inaccurate record ( which displays a totally different social security number XXXX to my consumer report. I demanded a supervisor - said "" XXXX XXXX '' who was rude at onset of conversation. She claimed they did n't "" add '' it in a condescending way. Semantically, they may not have "" reported '' it BUT they assuredly "" added, '' "" inserted, '' or otherwise included a record that did n't appear before today, and had been previously regarded as inaccurate and NOT included on my consumer report. She also claimed that they did n't have a copy of my police report for identity theft. This is becoming a broken record response XXXX, and all of these so-called legitimate credit/check reporting agencies. I 've uploaded the documents right here through the CFPB online portal for each complaint I 've sent. The repetition and consistency I 've exhibited makes it HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ILLOGICAL that I have not perfected service of my records showing indisputable proof that I 've been the victim of identity theft. So here I am AGAIN having "" only the option '' according to said "" XXXX XXXX '' to file a dispute and WAIT for the processing time. There should be more immediate and binding relief for victims of identity theft and IMMEDIATE and BINDING SANCTIONS for these agencies.

1428,2016-05-10,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"( this is a follow up to the complaint XXXX. I applied for a loan modification with the lender at their suggestion and they suggested that I look into foreclosure as a solution. After all the wrongdoings from XXXX XXXX, the person who will be most hurt is myself ) I applied for a construction to permanent loan with XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. With the builders contract, they required me to borrow more money than the original contract to ensure the home 's completion. During the course of construction, the builder stole approximately the same amount of money which was over {$100000.00}, did n't complete the home, but XXXX XXXX closed the loan and made it a home mortgage loan ( not a construction loan ). The home was never completed and the builder sued for {$250000.00}. After two years of trials and arbitration, the builder lost but did not pay the award or legal fees. Home is still not completed. 
Before the suit started, I applied for a loan modification and was denied it because I had been paying my mortgage. When I could no longer pay for the legal fees and mortgage, I fell behind with my mortgage payments and was able to get into a loan modification program. It took over 2 years and near the end of the process with XXXX XXXX ( I thought ), I paid over {$10000.00} in fees for the modification and after the last payment the loan was transferred to XXXX and then onto XXXX XXXX. I continued to work with XXXX XXXX on the modification for another year or so. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX they approved the modification, and gave me 4 hours to sign the documentation and return it to them. XXXX. I did not check my email that day ( the notification for the modification was emailed ) because I spent the day in the hospital with my parents. The same day the loan was also sold to XXXX XXXX, effectively cancelling the modification. 
After some time, XXXX XXXX accepted the original terms of the loan modification. It is a 40 yr loan with over {$300000.00} ( estimated ) in penalties added to the loan for time I was attempting to modify the loan. 
Last year the same loan was transferred to Rushmore with the same conditions, although for many weeks it was unclear where I should send my mortgage payments, and I feared might again fall behind in the payments. 
It is just very unfortunate that due to the predatory practices of XXXX, an unscrupulous builder that stole from the construction draws ( mainly from lies and asking me to make payments for materials and to contractors with the promise of repayment from the loan ), XXXX XXXX continuing to issue the draws to the builder, and XXXX unwilling to help keep the loan from going underwater, I am now in a situation where I have a home I can not sell and a loan I will probably not be able to payoff in my lifetime. Added to this burden was the legal fees owed to save the house. 
I have included with this explanation, many of the documents used during the trial and arbitration. Note, the builder lost the original lawsuit, the arbitration case, a XXXX lawsuit, and an appeal. To date, he has not paid any part of the judgement. 
1 ) lawsuit from builder ( XXXX pp ) 2 ) summary of costs lost during the construction of the home ( XXXX pp, {$70000.00} ) 3 ) summary from home inspection and cost to complete ( XXXX pp, {$120000.00} ) 4 ) summary of out-of-pocket legal fees ( XXXX pp, {$13000.00} ) 5 ) summary of legal fees for attorney ( XXXX pp, {$62000.00} )",,Rushmore Loan Management Services LLC,NM,875XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-05-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1917642

1430,2016-04-15,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,No notice of investigation status/result,"This is a complaint against the credit bureaus for not fully investigating my disputes and very poor re-investigation. 
I have been writing the Credit Bureaus and attempting to explain to them that the information on my Credit Report is inaccurate but yet the refuse to correct it. Over the last 2-years not only has the Creditors have became a Nightmare but the Credit Reporting Agencies Especially TransUnion. TransUnion 's tell you to go online and do a dispute, and even upload documents to prove your disputes and even then, they do not update and report the accurate information. Not to mention TransUnion charges monthly fees to check or monitor you credit report and mislead you with tricks. 

Item # Reason for Deletion XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) : Account Number : XXXX ... ..Failure to Validate Debt with ( XXXX ) please see Debt Validation Letter/ Certified Receipt and Certified confirmation that XXXX received the Debt Validation Letter. 

XXXX .... Account Number : XXXX ... ... Never Paid Late/Please see XXXX 2016 Statement XXXX XXXX .... Account Number : XXXX ... ... Update to show paid as agreed/closed/ Please see Letters from XXXX showing account paid and letter agreed to show "" paid as agreed '' XXXX XXXX ... Account Number : XXXX ... ... Not My Account/Removal Letter attached from XXXX Directly Former Address Removal : ... ... ... Never Lived at that address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX I wrote and faxed several dispute about the accounts referenced above. I have disputed this account information as inaccurate with TransUnion, and TransUnion have come back to me and stated they were able to verify these inaccurate accounts. How is this possible? Under the laws of the FDCPA, I have contacted the collection agency myself and have been unable to get them to verify that this is indeed my debt. So of the creditors and collection agencies have sent letters stating they have removed the errors. 

I enclose copies of my requests to the collection agencies and creditors, asking them to validate my debts, and the receipts showing that I sent these letter certified signature request. Some of these debts are not mine and inaccurate and I was given no evidence of my obligation to pay this debt to any collection agency. 

After contacting XXXX XXXX directly multiple times, I was told that XXXX XXXX does not have this debt anymore and it is now owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX Recovery Department. When asked about information concerning the XXXX XXXX card they transfer me back to XXXX XXXX who still has yet to send any documentation validating the amount owed, a statement or even anything showing that XXXX converted XXXX XXXX Credit Card, but yet EACH Credit Reporting Agencies, XXXX, TRANSUNION and XXXX still shows a debt with XXXX XXXX. 

The FCRA requires you to verify the validity of the item within 30 days. If the validity can not be verified, you are obligated by law to remove the item. There is a clear case of unverified debt here, and I urge you to remove this item before I am forced to take legal action. 

In the event that TransUnion can not verify the item pursuant to the FCRA, and TransUnion continues to list the disputed item on my credit report I will find it necessary to sue you for actual damages and declaratory relief under the FCRA. According to this regulation, I may need to sue TransUnion in any qualified state or federal court, including small claims court in my area. 

While I prefer not to litigate, I will use the courts as needed to enforce my rights under the FCRA. 

I look forward to an uneventful resolution of this matter

1448,2015-12-10,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I have been making payments on my home mortgage for 15 years and never been late on a payment. When a balloon payment came due, the current service provider told me that I would have to pay the amount in full, or they would foreclose on my home. I could not obtain the large amount of money needed to pay the loan, so I sought to refinance. Select Portfolio Services ( the service provider ) told me they could not refinance the property, that the only option I had was to pay it in full or default and lose my home. 
I finally found a company that would refinance for me, and began to ask SPS to provide me certain documentation in order to complete the process. It has taken over three months at this time, and it still is in process. The mortgage changed providers numerous times, and along the way it changed from XXXX as the lien holder to XXXX who apparently owns the lien. When I finally got to the point where we could close, the title company obtained a copy of the title on the home, and it showed XXXX as the lien holder. Since all the supporting documentation showed that SPS was servicing the loan for XXXX, the title company asked that SPS provide a document showing that the lien changed hands from XXXX to XXXX, but SPS refuses to do this. I 'm suspecting that there may be no proof of who owns the loan, since SPS can not provide me with any documentation of this simple fact. I called XXXX and they said they had no records of the loan. I called XXXX and they also told me that there was nothing in their records. SPS insists that they have to say that because SPS is the service provider, and only they can divulge information. I should have been able to close on this months ago, and because they will not assist me, I am now behind in XXXX payments and it will soon begin to affect my excellent credit rating. My mother ( who dwells in the home ) receives almost daily calls from SPS asking for payment and threatening to evict her if payments are n't submitted. She obviously is very upset about this, always in tears and being an elderly woman with serious health problems, this is stress that threatens her well being. I just want to close on my refinance, payoff this mortgage and cut all ties with this company. Can they legally prevent me from moving forward by not supplying the necessary documentation? Are n't I entitled to this information? What can I do to hold them accountable?

Sometime around XXXX XXXX, 2014, someone had gotten my debit card number. They then used this number to order food from XXXX. I was completely oblivious to the fact at the time. Both my income and my fiancee 's income were going into the same bank account, and we both had debit cards on the XXXX account. Meaning lots of charges were made each day ranging from {$3.00} to $ XXXX. I rarely checked the actual statements, just the balance from my mobile app. 

The person first started using this card on XXXX XXXX, 2014. They used it sparingly at first, every couple of days. Seeing around {$20.00} every couple days was not a red flag for me, since we were both using the cards every day. This went on for four months. Sometime around XXXX XXXX, when the person was full blown ordering XXXX a day, sometimes XXXX, I noticed that the amount I could have sworn should have been in my bank account was much much lower. So I investigated. I saw these XXXX charges ( see the XXXX pages of charges attached ) and immediately asked my fiancee. He was not ordering from that website. I called the bank and told them to cancel the card and file a fraud statement, I called XXXX, and I also went down to the police station to file a police report. A few days later I check the account again, more charges from XXXX. The bank had failed to cancel the card like they had stated they did and more charges were made. They finally cancelled the card and the last charge from XXXX was made on XXXX XXXX, 2014. 

So, After much hassle I fill out and mail in the affidavits for the fraudulent charges and wait some months for the funds to be put back into my account. The total amount of fraudulent charges made was {$1500.00} ( see attached sheet of replaced funds ). I start seeing charges being refunded, but not nearly as many as there should be. So I called the bank again and they told me something shocking. They will only replace the charges that were made within 60 days of the FIRST fraudulent charge. Meaning, they refunded {$610.00} and I was out {$920.00}. They would n't even refund the charges made after they were supposed to have "" cancelled '' the debit card. How is this fair practice? I called many times after demanding to speak with a supervisor and they all told me the same thing. This is absolutely unfair practice.

I contacted Greentree in an attempt to modify my XXXX mortgage payments to an amount that I could continue paying. My ex-wife was considered unemployable due to her health condition. Greentree requested documentation which we immediately sent. We were told they would get back to us. During this process I was still trying to make mortgage payments at the expense of my own basic living expenses. I was able to find a roommate willing to pay all of the household bills so that I could make even partial payments. Greentree repeatedly assured us throughout XXXX and into XXXX that the modification was close to being completed. They agreed to add the real estate taxes for XXXX and XXXX to the loan at this point. They requested more documentation which was sent promptly. Our Greentree contact informed us by phone that they would be writing off the second mortgage in order to focus on collecting XXXX. At this point I was barely able to make even partial payments. I needed groceries and gas for my vehicle in order to have any income whatsoever. Greentree was taking money out of my savings account even when I had n't authorized it which generated overdraft fees in addition to the lack of income. XX/XX/XXXX Greentree decided that, instead of adding the taxes to the loan, they would pay the taxes and give us an additional payment to the mortgage payment. When the payment was returned for insufficient funds, they said we 'd have to start the whole process all over again after almost two years. At this point both my household and my ex-wife 's household were receiving up to XXXX calls per day from Greentree asking for payment. We talked about what options were available to us with our contact and, with Greentree 's help, we began the steps to do what they called a short sale. We contacted a real estate agent who knew an attorney who dealt with short sales and they agreed to help us. Greentree sent us a packet of forms required for the short sale and we returned them promptly. Our agent and attorney were also communicating with Greentree and were experienced the same issues that we had run into during the modification process. Greentree was unwilling to allow any communication by e-mail and insisted all communication on their end be handled by phone only. XX/XX/XXXX the house as listed for sale 'as is '. There were XXXX bids placed. We accepted the one that was over the list price and submitted the bid to Greentree ; who then sent their own appraiser to do comps in the area. The offer exceeded his appraisal figure. Our attorney was in contact with Greentree and was assured that things were progressing well and that we would hear something back in about a week on our buyer 's offer. She was also assured that the second mortgage was going to be written off. The inspector hired by the buyer found hail damage on the roof that would need to be replaced. We had our own inspector take a look at it and he agreed with the assessment. The buyer amended his offer to a lower amount for this reason. We submitted the amended amount to Greentree with an explanation. By this time the contact at Greentree was giving conflicting statements to our attorney. She went to a supervisor and was told that the second mortgage was not being forgiven and that the requests had been submitted as another modification which would require more documentation. The buyer withdrew his offer due to Greentree 's incompetence. XX/XX/XXXX we requested a deed in lieu of foreclosure from Greentree at which time we were informed that the house was going into full foreclosure and we were n't eligible for that option. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX it was sold at auction for approximately {$76000.00}, which was under the amended offer of {$78000.00} for the short sale. Contact me for more.

The XXXX transactions took place on XXXX XXXX, 2015 - {$5600.00}, XXXX XXXX, 2015 - {$870.00} and XXXX XXXX 2015 - {$1000.00}. The transactions for {$870.00} and {$1000.00}, were taken care of, but the {$5600.00} was never credited. Initially, I contacted the bank within the normal dispute time requirement, but the bank representatives never took responsibility. I did NOT receive documentation in XXXX, 2015 to dispute the charges, or any other form of documentation to dispute the charges for the rest of the year. 
I made repeated calls for months with no response, to People 's United Bank, shortly after contacting them about the charge. I contacted People 's United Bank repeatedly, to take care of the {$5600.00}, with no response. I finally got a hold of the head of the ACH/dispute/fraud department and was issued a fax number after opening the complaint with the XXXX, yet I still did not receive any response from the company, even after sending the documents. 

People 's United Bank closed my account, without any warning or justification after I contacted them about this matter, hoping to discourage me, from pursuing this matter with them. I can justify this fact, because when I called about my account issue, they explained that they could n't assist me, because of my closed account. 

People 's United Bank has carried out a litany of unethical business practices and displayed blatant financial misconduct. People 's United Bank needs to be held responsible for their actions. 

I have proof of the transaction, paid by other means, via bank statement. I will also provide proof of email communication and call logs from my phone ( date/time ) during the date range, the transaction occurred with People 's United Bank. Fax confirmations, proving that I contacted People 's United Bank within recommended time frames, which also contained the necessary information to pursue the dispute, was also saved.",,People's United Bank,CT,060XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2016-06-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1954443

I asked for {$20.00} in cash and {$580.00} deposited. The teller, XXXX, completed my transaction and gave me an envelope with cash and my receipt. I left the bank and went to work. I did not look inside the envelope because I did not want to use the money right then nor have I ever encountered an issue with a transaction. I left work at XXXX, I traveled from XXXX to downtown XXXX for my overnight job XXXX - XXXX. When I got off and went home, I opened the envelope and found {$200.00} and my receipt showing a balance of {$630.00} and {$580.00} deposit. I took a nap until the bank opened at XXXX. I called up to the bank and told the teller that they gave me too much money, the very rude XXXX abruptly stopped me in mid conversation and passed the phone to XXXX. I told patty that I received too much money, XXXX replied that she know and that she withdraw {$180.00} from my account. I asked her who authorized her to access my account and withdraw money, she said i called you. I replied that I did not get a call and i did not authorize her. She informed me that my balance was {$9.00} and that I did not have any overdrafts so I was fine. FINE??? {$9.00}???? I hung up the phone and checked my account, I saw that I was charged {$400.00} in overdraft fees!!! on XXXX/XXXX/16, i had a balance of {$360.00} in my checking and {$630.00} in my savings. I had {$320.00} worth of transactions on XXXX/XXXX/16 and a PENDING deposit of {$580.00} when XXXX withdraw {$180.00}. I called back up the bank and informed XXXX of this issue. She replied that she needed the money back and its nothing she can do about the overdraft charges, she said that bank manager was not in and from what she can see I would have been over drafted anyway. excuse me??? I explained to her that on XXXX/XXXX/16 I have {$360.00} and minus {$320.00} I still was positive {$41.00} with a pending {$580.00} deposit that would have been available on XX/XX/XXXX and that the {$180.00} was taking from my current balance not the pending transaction. She said she will look into it but its nothing she can do. I called the XXXX #, various branches and even emailed the CEO and NO ONE WANTED TO ASSIST ME. I was told that i was already in overdraft, I was told that the XXXX branch had to fix it, i 've been argued with and treated like I was nothing by several reps over the course of 3 days. I was belittled by the assistant manager at the XXXX branch, by XXXX at the XXXX branch, by the branch manager in XXXX - XXXX XXXX branch. I have not received a follow up from my email nor have I spoken with XXXX XXXX ( i left voice mails ). This has been a horrific experience and I have never been made to feel so low about a bank error in my life. The customer service is below scum, out of the XXXX people that I spoke with XXXX was the ONLY one that listened, attempted to fix and called me back.

So why am I being forced to pay a fee that is the servicer responsibility as per this agreement. They are forcing this additional cost, which may cause me to have to come up with an additional {$4300.00}. Also, since they owned the home prior to me closing, should they not provide me a credit proration on my CD from XX/XX/XXXX till the day of closing, and how would this work if I 'm being force to pay such fee?

I am obligated to pay {$360.00} and have been paying {$100.00} a week instead. To date I have paid {$5800.00}. 
Avant has only applied {$2200.00} to principal. To further test their wrongful allocation of monies I am paying them from online bill pay through XXXX XXXX XXXX, I sent in a {$5.00} payment and in the comments put "" principal only '' - they added this payment to interest XXXX % along with the next payment of {$210.00}. The {$5.00} payment was made on XXXX and the {$210.00} payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX 

The facts are simple. They agreed over the phone around XX/XX/XXXX ( they record all calls and the calls can be subpoenaed ) that any extra payments would be applied to principal. They are treating my principal reduction payments as though they are advance payments which they are not. There are no prepayment penalties. 

Avant 's deceptive allocation of principal payments have made it next to impossible for me to payoff my loan early as a responsible consumer. They have not clearly outlined in writing how a consumer can make principal only payments and by creating this breakage model, are effectively creating a prepayment penalty which the contract I signed expressly indicates that there is no prepayment penalty. Their deceptive payment allocation practices amount to constructively blocking a person 's ability to pay out their loan early thereby saving them interest as evidenced by the fact that even a payment labeled "" principal only '' was put 100 % to interest. 

When you divide the interest applied ( {$3500.00} ) from the total amount paid ( {$5500.00} ) the effective interest rate I have paid is 60.9 %. My contract states that my APR is 35.94 %.

1669,2015-06-03,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"I was pre-appreoved for a mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/2014 with Franklin First Financial. I was directed into an FHA mortgage because of my troubled credit history. I was not made aware of the up front funding fee or the annual insurance premium until days before the closing. Yes, I was provided with disclosures, whether they were provided timely I am not sure, but they were not explained to me, rather I was told I needed to sign them or the loan would be declined. 
During the course of the process, my lender was not transparent and was often impossible to contact to help answer routine questions. I asked several times a week when I could epxect an estimate on closing costs, I didnt receive the final GFE until 2 hours before the closing. I was quoted 4 % the entire time, I questioned why the application said 4.5 % he said it 's because he had to 'throw any rate in ' to complete the application. The night before the closing I learned this was my rate and there was nothing I could do about it. Mysteriously, an XXXX $ credit appeared on the HUD settlement statement to help offset the increased rate, but this credit went directly to the seller as he was responsible for all closing costs according to the purchase and sales. 
The lender took well over 2 months to close this loan, which resulted in huge financial penalties to me. I stayed in my home I was renting two months longer than expected and the seller of the property lost his patience along the way and threatened to charge per diem and walk away from the deal many times creating a very stressful situation for me and my family. During the course of this, I recieved a denial letter in the mail after being told by the lender the same day that I would be closing the next week. The underwriter was mistaken, and I had to provide knowledge of rule changes in order for the bank to proceed. The seller, who will be recieving his own series of complaints, held our deposit in his personal account and spent it, prior to closing. We were pre-approved with another lender and wanted to go to him but we could n't do so because our deposit was spent and our seller threated to walk away if we did n't close. 
Further, the seller was in contact with the closing attorney 's office the day of the closing making changes to the HUD up to 30 minutes before the closing, adding miscellaneous fees and costs to reduce the amount of his closing costs, without my knowledge or consent. At closing, I was asked to write a check for XXXX $ which was the additional deposit amount required when I made a change to the purchase and sales changing the purchase amount from XXXX to XXXX. I already paid this difference via check to the seller and the lender failed to request evidence of this payment prior to closing, so as a result I was forced to pay it again and told to 'ask for it back ' from the seller ( who had been so reasonable throughout. ) I could go on and on, and I 'd be happy to, but I feel that I 've provided enough information to get an inquiry started.

1686,2016-05-02,Mortgage,Reverse mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"We purchased our home XXXX XXXX with a reverse mortgage originated by XXXX XXXX and transferred to Reverse mortgage Solutions ( RMS ). On XXXX XXXX, XXXX we received a notice from RMS that we owed {$1100.00} for delinquent taxes and insurance. I called customer service for an explanation and was told {$790.00} was for insurance they paid due to a lapse of coverage of my homeowners insurance and {$390.00} was for unpaid property taxes.Regarding the insurance charge : We have a Homeowners Association that covers the property and the policy at time of closing was a 3 year policy that did not terminate until XX/XX/XXXX. I referred her to my HOA and they faxed a copy of the policy to RMS. I was forced to do this on 3 separate occasions over a 2 year period and each time I was reassured by an RMS representative that it "" would be taken care of ''. It never was. 
Regarding the claim for unpaid taxes : During the same 2 year period when I attempted to solve the insurance issue I asked for the date the supposed tax payment was not made and was told "" sometime during the tax year of XXXX. I have cancelled checks verifying all taxes paid om time from XXXX thru XXXX, therefore there could not have been a "" missing '' tax payment for that period. 
After each of these sessions with an RMS rep I would receive a monthly statement showing no delinquent charges which led me to believe that finally we had cured the issues. Not so. 
XXXX XXXX we were placed in foreclosure by RMS. Realizing working with a customer service rep was not accomplishing any results I contacted the department head and was told he would start and investigation. As a result of their investigation, RMS agreed the {$790.00} insurance charge was not valid and credited the charge to my loan balance. His research into the tax issue discovered that the mortgage originator, XXXX XXXX when preparing the closing documents included XXXX, XXXX and XXXX quarter taxes but did not compensate for the XXXX quarter taxes. 
Not sure why with all of my dealings with RMS.s reps over a 2 year period no one was able to provide me with this information, however after being provided with the proper accounting breakdown I realized how the mistake occurred and the claim was legitimate. I forwarded a cashiers check and assumed that the 2 year ordeal of stress and frustration was finally over ... not so. Two days after RMS received my cashiers check, they filed a "" notice of default '' against our property!! 
Initially, I felt we were just dealing with an inept dysfunctional organization, however it appears this is a deliberate company strategy to rip-off innocent people and acquire their property. My wife and I are both honest responsible people in our XXXX 's with in excess of {$100000.00} in equity in our home. At no time during this process we were not willing or unable to pay the disputed amounts, however we knew without a doubt the insurance charge was not valid so why were we to accept the claim for the taxes when we were never provided any type of accounting that this was owed by us. Furthermore, we received monthly statements from RMS and these items never once appeared anywhere on the breakdown even though there were specific line items addressing both of these items, they also showed XXXX balance owed. For us having to deal with the constant intimidation and coercion from this company may not be illegal but is unquestionably unconscionable and they need to be stopped somehow from their deceitful practices.

1696,2015-05-21,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"I have a mortgage with Seterus , inc . 
My current regular monthly payment amount is {$920.00}. 
I 'm also current in my payments and never failed to make a payment on time. 
I want to submit a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about XXXX payment. 
On XXXX XXXX, I mailed the payment for XXXX 2015. The check was for the amount of {$2100.00}. I clearly specified on the check and also on the payment coupon that I wanted the ramainder amount ( {$1100.00} ) after XXXX payment to go to the principal. 
I have attached proof of this. 

Seterus cashed the check on XXXX XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX I checked my Seterus account online and noticed that they had spread the amount I submitted for XXXX between XXXX and XXXX 2015, contrary to my instructions. 
I called on XXXX XXXX. I explained the problem to the agent and she said she had submitted the request to reverse the payment and correctly put the ramainder to principal. She also said they had up to 14 days to complete this reversal. 
So I waited 14 days. 

On XXXX XXXX, I checked online again but saw Seterus had not corrected the issue so I called for a XXXX time and asked why the issue was still not fixed. The agent said they were running behind with customer requests and then said she was going to find out what was going on. She put me on hold and when she came back she said that they would be fixing the issue on that same day and that I could check the next day online. 
The next day, on XXXX XXXX, I checked online again but still no reversal had taken place so I called for the XXXX time and talked to an agent named XXXX. 
All he said was that he had resubmitted my request to fix XXXX payment. He did n't explain to me why they had not reversed the payment yet. 
I said I would be calling the next day ( on XXXX XXXX ) to check again but the agent said there would n't be any turnaround time the next day and I needed to wait for what that department decided to do with the matter and that there was nothing I could do to expedite that as they had to review and evaluate my account. 
I said to him that I would call again regardless because I had initiated the reversal request on XXXX XXXX ( over 14 days ago ), not on XXXX XXXX. 
I called today once again and inquired about the status of my request on my initial call on XXXX XXXX. The agent said she would need to see the history of my calls and put me on hold. After XXXX minutes she came back and said that a request for the XXXX payment reversal was NEVER submitted. She said she had submitted it for the XXXX time and apologized. 
What is really going on here? I 'm totally perplexed. 

This is not the XXXX time Seterus incorrectly spreads the payment between XXXX or more months. They did this in XXXX 2015 and after I called them XXXX times they finally fixed this. 

I have a lot of questions and after so many calls and unfulfilled expectations, I believe I 'm getting nowhere and I also feel I have also wasted too much time with them to no avail. I also feel there is absolutely no transparency on their behalf to resolve this issue and that they have been lying to me making me believe that reversal process is already moving when it 's not. 
There is absolutely XXXX communication from them back to me via email, online or phone as a customer with a request to follow up. 

At this point, the next statement I have is for XXXX 2015 as they skipped XXXX 2015 after posting the extra money for XXXX. 
There are 10 days left before XXXX XXXX so I do n't know if this can get resolved before then. Otherwise, I 'm afraid if they do the reversal too late then I will be behind for the XXXX payment and then they will charge me late fees. I do n't know what to do. I have almost lost a month for nothing. 
I 'm submitting evidence that supports my case, statements, copies of check and coupon. 
Let me know if there is anything else you need from me so this matter can be resolved. 

Thank you!

( CA herein ). First major delinquency was XX/XX/XXXX due to loss of employment & the balance due according to XXXX credit bureaus is {$3600.00}, but balance due as reported by CA {$3500.00}. The XXXX value of the repo 'd SUV for dealer trade in TODAY is {$1200.00} & SUV was repo 'd in XX/XX/XXXX. I did n't receive notice of the sale of the vehicle, but was furnished a copy of what CA claimed to have sent me regarding resale. No deficiency balance ever noted!!! A couple years went by with no correspondence from CA until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when the sheriff delivered me a final judgment, entered by default as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Upon receiving this, I called XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX herein ) who identified themselves as debt collectors for CA saying the balance due as of judgment is now {$6900.00} & to call for payment arrangements. I was confused and skeptical, as I had already paid roughly {$20000.00} on the contract & there was no record of a deficiency balance applied. 
After researching more on my own, as circumstantially I could not afford legal advisory, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I sent a request via certified mail usps to XXXX for a complete debt validation to include all info in my file, the original contract & a full accounting of all transactions. In response to my request on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I only received a general response & a copy of the final judgment, no debt validation & no account of the proceeds, deficiency balance or how the sale was processed & there are NO DOCUMENTED PROCEEDS from the deficiency balance towards what is owed, EVER. I was hesitant to make pymnt arrangements in fear of validating the debt, but when I called the courthouse to verify the judgment, it was on file as a legally binding document. As of XX/XX/XXXX, CA has reported the account status with all XXXX credit bureaus with the delinquencies and repossession noted, but never once was a judgment or public notice recorded & said account has been closed as of XX/XX/XXXX, to be scheduled for removal by XX/XX/XXXX. All XXXX credit bureaus reported the same data. Something was n't right & I had read hundreds of complaints via internet regarding unfair & illegal practices by CA. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I hesitantly made the first payment of 9 for the {$75.00} arrangement agreement to XXXX from my XXXX checking and have the records. The most recent payment cleared XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Within that time period, I 've only received XXXX notices from XXXX, the most recent dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, stating the amount due was {$7400.00} & that their "" client has informed them of a special opportunity to fully satisfy this debt by payment of a significantly reduced amount ''. No other forms of correspondence attempted. Last Thursday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I went to use my debit card and it was declined even though I had over {$1700.00} in my account & had just deposited my payroll. XXXX bank informed me that my account was levied by CA & without any prior notice from my bank or CA. The telephone # I was given sends me to a TN county clerk & that is all the contact info provided. I still have yet to receive any notice from my bank or XXXX or CA regarding the levy & questioning if all this is legal practice. I 've heard of CA judgments being vacated after entered due to CA filing fraudulent affidavits with the courts. When I calculate the amount due under the terms by CA in the judgment, I get completely different amounts and I think they are suing for interest on attorney fees, other interest charges and there are credits of {$0.00} for deficiency and resale of SUV? I definitely can not afford a lawyer now & thinking this is a fraudulent attempt to collect before the SOL is up because the judgment is fraud. Can they take all of my payroll check deposited just before too? I am asking for help with the legalities of this please

In fact, when it was transferred to Selene, my monthly payment due was at a zero balance. However, some where during the transition of my loan, a mistake was made within Selene, which caused my loan to become past due.

But, I now feel Selene has mishandled our payments and applied them to someone else 's loan. In addition, they began to return my payments stating that my payments were not the correct amount of my loan, in fact, with the original checks that they returned to me, they also returned someone else 's Cashier 's Check to me, which was for a "" Loan Modification ''. I would like to mention that I never requested for a Loan Modification with Selene, but this Cashier 's Check was for a Loan Modification for someone else 's account. Thus, we requested from Selene a reconciliation of our account, and to send us copies of our Tax Bill and Year End Escrow Account Statement, which we requested from them numerous times and for approximately 15 months later, we have not yet received any documentations of what we requested.

1822,2016-03-02,Consumer Loan,Vehicle lease,Managing the loan or lease,,"My father died in XXXX XXXX. At the time he leased a vehicle from GM Financial. I returned my father 's car to the dealer in XXXX XXXX and GM Financial sold the vehicle at auction on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX resulting in a surplus. It has been nearly XXXX months and I can not get GM financial to send me the refund. This is the last outstanding item before I can close his estate. I 'm asking your help to get GM Financial to send me the refund and close the lease account. 
I attached XXXX documents. The first is a statement GM Financial sent after they sold the returned vehicle at auction. The second document is a copy of the monthly bill they keep sending me seeking {$970.00} in property taxes. That amount applies to all of XXXX and has not been prorated based on the date of sale ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). It also does not apply any of the surplus from the sale. 
The paperwork I received after the vehicle was sold indicated that there was a surplus of {$1700.00}. But it does not appear to be applied correctly to the account. Total costs related to the sale ( line XXXX ) are shown as {$710.00}, but Credit : Surplus Received ( line XXXX ) also shows {$710.00}, not the actual figure of {$1700.00}. Also, the subsequent bill for {$970.00} in property taxes has not been prorated for the partial year nor does it apply any credit from the surplus. I finally spoke with a customer service representative on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX who agreed that after making these corrections I should be getting a refund of {$570.00}. I 'm still waiting. 
I 'll also add some other information about my whole experience in this process because if I do n't tell anyone they ca n't make any changes regarding how they operate. When I first called to report that my father had died and I asked what to do with his car, I was told someone would call me back. I did receive a few voice messages from someone saying they were calling to "" follow up with me, '' leaving only a first name and a toll free number. The callers did not identify themselves as being from GM Financial or state what they were calling about. If a family member has just died and I receive a suspicious call like this, why on Earth would I call the number? Thinking maybe it could be GM Financial, I looked up the number online and found no connection to GM Financial, but I did find postings from other people with a similar experience, wondering who could be calling them. In retrospect it probably was them, but I was never sure. I eventually managed to work with the dealer and return the car to them to hold for GM Financial. The car was sold at auction and I received a package indicating there was a surplus due from the sale. For months I 've been trying to collect. When I called the main customer service line, I was told I needed to speak to the lease recovery department. The problem is the lease recovery department is a voicemail box, not a person. I 've never had any of my messages returned. Only when I filed a complaint through their website was I able to get someone to call me back ( on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). In the meantime, I continue to receive a bill every month for the ( incorrect ) property tax. No one seems to be taking action on this. I understand that when a lease holder dies it is a default- but there really ought to be a process for families who in good faith are just trying to return the vehicle to the leasing company and resolve the account without this nearly nine-month ordeal. And after all they got all the money they were owed- I have not.

My fiance purchased a vehicle and this auto loan was financed through Santander Consumer USA in XXXX, TX at 21 % interest. In Massachusetts, it was confirmed by the Attorney General 's office that this is against state law and the usury department at the Attorney General 's office confirmed that the bank DID NOT register or seek approval in advance to write loans exceeding the state cap of 20 %. They are willing to put this in writing. We contacted Santander Consumer USA and they declined taking the vehicle back, voiding the loan and refunding what we have paid. According to state law, the loan is invalid and needs to be negated by a supreme court judge. The legal department had advised Santander Customer service to cease and desist collection practices as of XXXX/XXXX/16, but they could not tell us why. I have full authorization to speak on behalf of my fiance on the auto loan. We have been passed in circles from Attorney General 's office, Consumer Protection Agency, Usury Department of the Attorney General 's office, now to the Division of banks, which then passed us back to your office. Everyone is in agreement that this loan should be null and void, yet no one will assist us past that point. We have made numerous attempts to find an attorney on a contingency fee basis, but we have hit a dead end. We give them basic information, they claim they think they can help us then never return our calls. This bank just settled a lawsuit filed by the Massachusetts Attorney General for predatory lending practices ( charging higher than the state cap ) but since that case was settled, we are basically left scrambling to obtain assistance until they receive enough similar cases to proceed with a new case. We need to stop being referred in circles and actually obtain assistance. We were told by XXXX separate agencies that your bureau oversees Santander bank. The only documents we have are from the bank denying our request as mentioned above. The attorney general 's office is in the process of mailing the document stating they did not register with the AGO to write loans exceeding 20 %. Which is why our loan should be considered null and void.

1856,2016-03-01,Debt collection,Credit card,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"On XXXX XXXX XXXX I received a lawsuit notice from my county that I was being sued by Capital One Bank for {$2300.00}. I was shocked about this because I sent multiple letters to Capital One that the debt was not mine and asked them to validate the debt they say I owe or stop contacting me. Only response I did get was letters saying that I had applied for credit online and I owe the money from XX/XX/XXXX. No copy of a contract with my signature and I have never had an account with Capital One or any type of credit cards with them. Even if you pull up my credit report Capital One is no where to be found. I decided to fight the allegations because I never received credit from this bank and they never showed any proof that I owed them this money. I thought it would be an easy case and the judge would make them show proof that I owe them. I asked the courts to have Capital One show proof by requesting contract with my signature or any docs showing I owe the alleged debt but I was denied anything showing this, judge even denied my discovery request that I asked them to show any evidence of anything about the debt, even some type of agreement. Capital One does not have anything other than some old statements from another company which is a third party company that anyone could have created. I asked Capital One to show where they may have received an assignment for this debt from third party but there was nothing showing this either other than an affidavit that said I owed the debt from some rep that works for Capital One. This is hearsay but courts granted Capital One a judgement even though they did not proof or have any evidence that I even own the debt. I have denied that I owed the debt since XX/XX/XXXX and no one from Capital One has sent me anything showing that I borrowed money or received any credit from them. They keep pushing that I owe this money but I have stated several times this debt is not mine and if it is please show proof. Within our court hearing the attorney that represents Capital One even stated they do not have any records other than the statements and the debt was purchased bulk with other debt accounts. They can not confirm that this debt belongs to me. They are just going after me due to old statements that they received when purchasing bulk debt. Not sure how you can say I owe something when you do n't have any type of agreement that says I will pay or I owe this money to you. The judgement was granted for Capital One to move forward with the collection of debt but I think my case was not handled fairly or even given due process. How can you grant someone money but the party that is suing for the funds do not have anything showing they have the right to collect. Capital One came from nowhere and just stated I owe the debt without evidence. They keep ignoring my request to show an agreement, assignment, contract, correct balance and it seems like the courts are working with them to collect this debt that is not mine. Not sure what else I can do other than to complain to CFPB due to Capital One continuing an attempt to collect a debt that I do not owe. Never had an account with Capital One and they ca n't even show that I had an account with them, where I made payments with them or even signed an agreement with them.

1881,2016-01-26,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"COMPLAINT AGAINST EXXON MOBIL Exxon has refused to provide answers to questions requested by me and my attorney to support the reporting of derogatory information to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX regarding an alleged debt to my account. 
On or about XXXX XXXX unauthorized charges were made to my Exxon Mobile credit card ( by Exxon. ) If Exxon mailed statements they were sent to an incorrect mailing address. Additionally, any contact information Exxon had on record, including my email, work address and phone number were incorrect as well. 
I discovered this in XXXX XXXX when I reviewed my credit report. I noticed Exxon put derogatory remarks regarding late payments made to Exxon on my XXXX, XXXX and XXXX credit reports. In response, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I called Exxon and spoke with their representative XXXX and I explained to him my situation. XXXX confirmed that Exxon did not have any current contact information. I told him that I did not have possession of a valid Exxon credit card, never activated a new credit card and have not received statements for quite some time, because I stopped using the card. 
I provided XXXX my current address and contact information as well as requested that my Exxon account be cancelled. After we spoke about the balance on my card, XXXX put me on hold and spoke with a supervisor. When he got back on line he told me my card would be cancelled and that all charges and late fees on my account would be removed. Since Exxon is not a philanthropic organization I am sure they realized this situation was just a big mistake and not my fault so their reversing of all charges was the appropriate action to take. 
XXXX of XXXX, I filed a dispute with the XXXX credit bureaus regarding the late payments reported by Exxon. In my letter I explained to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX that Exxon determined no legitimate charges were made, no balance was ever due and no payments were necessary or required. In my letter I asked XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to remove all derogatory reporting regarding late payments. I was surprised that in their response to my letter, dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( Attachment # XXXX ) Exxon stated that the information reported to the credit agencies accurately reflects my account history and the reporting can not be changed. 
Again, On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I sent another letter to Exxon, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. ( Attachment # XXXX ) requesting Exxon to explain how they can legitimately report late payments ( now 90 days ) to an account where all charges were reversed, no balance was due and no actual payments were ever made. In Exxon 's response dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX they stated that the information they reported to the credit agencies accurately reflects my account. Additionally, ( Exxon ) did not provide the information I requested regarding how my account balance was reduced to XXXX and how you can be late making a payment on a zero amount due. ( Attachment # XXXX ). 
As a result of Exxon 's refusal to provide verification of debt or how the balance due was paid, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX my attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX sent a letter to Exxon and the credit bureaus. Requesting verification of all legitimate charges to my account and to verify the nature as to how the debt was satisfied. ( Attachment # XXXX ) Again, Exxon sent back a ( form letter ) reply dated XXXX XXXX XXXX, stating that the information reported to the credit agencies accurately reflects my account history. Exxon refused to answer any questions ask by my attorney XXXX XXXX and did not verify the debt nor did they provide him the additional information we requested that was sent to the credit bureaus in response to my dispute.

I 've struggled with XXXX that have inhibited my ability to be as productive as possible since graduating college in XX/XX/XXXX. I 've been employed off-and-on during this time. First at a local hardware store, then, after an internship opportunity in XXXX that I allowed to slip because of my illness, and a period of unemployment and even XXXX XXXX ; at a local ski shop. Exacerbating this is my total debt : upwards of {$230000.00} and growing daily. I 've finally reached a point where I feel I am making some sort of progress, working with my doctors and my family ; however, these sorts of psychological hardships are completely ignored by ALL of my private financiers. 
When the six months were up ( this XX/XX/XXXX ... Bill due XX/XX/XXXX ) I immediately called Wells Fargo customer service to begin the process of applying for an additional forbearance while I continued work on my career outside of retail. The representative I spoke to was apprehensive at first, saying something about XXXX payment required -- when I explained to him that the employee that I spoke to in XXXX had assured me I 'd be able to receive the additional forbearance he said something to the effect of "" Oh yeah, that 's right, you need to call back closer to your billing date, though. "" I assumed the information provided to me by multiple customer service representatives at Wells Fargo was correct and I waited until the day before my bill was due to call them to complete the application process. What happened next was astounding. 
Every single representative apologized, the information I had been provided previously was incorrect, there was nothing they could do, my bill was due the following day. I struggled for hours -- being punished for misinformation provided by their own customer service representatives seemed less than fair, possibly criminal. 
I have no doubt in my mind that the customer service representatives at Wells Fargo are trained in subterfuge, to delay these sorts of requests until it 's too late and then to completely shut down any hope of delaying billing. 
We 've began the process of loan modification but we 've been informed that our bill is still due, I 'll be forced to make below-minimum payments and to deal with possibly months of harassing collection calls. 
As someone already suffering from a handfull of XXXX illnesses the thought of surprise default or even just continued deceit can be quite literally crippling.

1989,2015-09-04,Credit card,,Other,,"American Express engages in several deceptive, unfair and abusive billing practices that result in higher interest charges. Most, but not all, relate to the fact that its printed statements that are mailed to my house are different from information provided on its website under various tabs such as "" Statements and Activity, '' and elsewhere, that are never kept current even at the end of a billing period. Additionally, PDFs of billing statements that are mailed are hard to find online, so that people who travel often, and who do not have time to but are forced to wade through all the in-your-face advertising and other extraneous junk on their cluttered website are steered towards web-based, alternative, but inaccurate versions of the account. Simultaneously, customers often have to wait a day or more to get earlier billing statements where an interest "" charge '' allegedly first occurred. The XXXX or more sources of the statements ( the real XXXX and whatever ephemeral, ersatz version or versions one can find at any particular time on various areas of its website ) are not identical but contain conflicted and inconsistent information. As a result, it is almost impossible to know what is due for any particular billing period. During most months, this has resulted in me typically paying more than is actually due. On some occasions, however, American Express claims that I underpaid the total amount due. If so, it is due to several of AMEX 's "" tricks and traps '' and I ask the CFPB to sanction it for them. 

In addition to the multiple and inconsistent versions of their "" statements '', it also falsely advertises cash back rewards, then does not credit them to the account at all or in a timely manner. It falsely claims that it provides 5 % cash back for grocery store, gas station and drug store purchases. Yet it does not do so in any reasonable sense of the word. For example, it does not classify XXXX XXXX as a drug store on its bills and does not list several gas stations, including XXXX and XXXX in NJ, as well as others, as a gas station, although they clearly are. ( Some of these seem to be categorized as "" fuel dispensing stations '' in distinction to gas stations. ) As a result of all of these intentional and actual deceptions by AMEX, it has been charging me interest, I only recently learned, since XXXX of this year while providing inaccurate and incomplete billing information online and pretending to provide cash back rewards to stimulate further usage of its card. 

The CFPB needs to monitor AMEX billing, online information, and cash back programs very closely. I should be issued credits for all interest and all advertised but uncredited cash back rewards, plus the same rate of interest on these new credits that it has charged me since I opened the account. Furthermore, AMEX should be forced to correct any derogatory or inaccurate information related to these deceptions that it reported to credit agencies about me and the other person on this account. Finally, AMEX should be fined and sanctioned for these activities and not permitted to repeat them at the risk of greater and steadily increasing penalties with each new offense.

If there is a radio button to initiate a response, I can not find it in your very pale pastel green links. 


XXXX XXXX 2015Case number : XXXXXXXXConsumer Finance Protection BureauSpecialized Loan ServicingI was n't surprised by SLS response to my complaint. Their knowledge and servicing of my HELOC falls far short of their fudicial responsibilities. 

1. SLS lacked full knowledge of XXXX requirements from the onset. 

2. Prior to XXXX XXXX, I rejected SLS 's offer to initiate an ACH. 

3. I denied their fredom to share my Personal Information with unaffiliates. 

4. I asseerted my intent to mail the 'Total MonthlyPayment ' as noted. 

5. SLS has failed to identify the institution executing monthly ACH dmands. 

6 SLS has refused to escalate my concerns beyond Executive Services. 

7. SLS characterizes our direct monthly payments as 'unapplied funds '. 

8. We submitted timely payments posting on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and with check # XXXX in the a mount of {$190.00} which SLS returned. 

9. SLS checks # XXXX are unauthorized. 

9. SLS has unnecessarily and adversely impacted our FICO scores. 

10 SLS has failed to correct their lack of oversight and make us whole. 


I formally request a TILA AUDIT on my HELOC contract in 2015 after SLS bought our loan. The attached documents clearly reveal our timely 'Total Monthly Payments ' accepted and processed electronically by SLS. 

SLS asserts they are 'only a Servicer ' for the 'Investors ''. SLS Agents express no knowledge regarding the ongoing ACH drafts in the amount of {$100.00} against our XXXX XXXX Checking Account. They have no access to view the actions of the 'Cash Operations ' division of Specialized Loan Servicing. They referred me to XXXX for resolution. 

I failed to discover the originator of the ACH demands. Neither XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), XXXX, nor XXXX XXXX could discern the identity of the ACH Originator. None of the above financial institutions has record of my HELOC under either of our Social Security Numbers. A resolution is beyond our capabilities. 

XXXX XXXX reversed XXXX ACH charges in question on XXXX/XXXX/15 for {$200.00} provisional credit, then XXXX more times on XXXX & XXXX for {$100.00} each. These Provisional Credits were for unauthorized drafts. We closed our XXXX XXXX checking account on XXXX/XXXX/15 to eliminate the unauthorized tapping of our funds. Specialized Loan Servicing and its assigns will attempt to process another ACH draft tomorrow. 

Prior to XXXX/XXXX/15, the HELOC ACH payees appeared on our XXXX XXXX statement as XXXX, ATTN : XXXX '. Beginning with the XXXX XXXX draft, the payee was designated 'Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC '. 
to me, this indicates a change in ownership. 

I received a copy of the original HELOC agreement with XXXX in XXXX indicating a minimum monthly payment of {$100.00} with XXXX. To resolve further contention with SLS, we posted a check on XXXX/XXXX/15 for the amount of {$190.00} to bring the loan current. That check was returned on XXXX. 

Due to SLS 's reprehensiible and negligent actions. our FICO score dropped XXXX points. SLS 's untimely actions have jeaprodized my XXXX stated intent to them to refinance the HELOC and rid their influence from our lives. 

As a consumer, I depend on financial institutions to provide me with timely and accurate information and interpretation of my financial commitments. SLS has failed in their fudicial responsibilities. 

If will be prudent for Specialized Loan Servicing to act fudicially, ethically, and without delay to restore my credit rating AND reverse any penalties and additional interest charges levied since they assumed ownership of my HELOC.

2105,2015-11-03,Bank account or service,Savings account,Deposits and withdrawals,,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to express my concerns about a behavior of Scottrade Bank and their affiliates which may have adversely exposed my personal information and lead to identity theft and fraud. 

Specifically, in going through my records in order to better understand how I could resolve ongoing identity theft, I discovered that when applying for a bank account at Scottrade Bank, Scottrade Bank improperly handled a number of documents which had very personal information on them. The actions of Scottrade Bank not only broke from the current standards of data security but also broke Scottrade Bank 's internal policies regarding handling customer information. 

Specifically, on or around XXXX XXXX, 2013 ( XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX, a regional manager from Scottrade Bank offered to receive Scottrade Bank account application documents via email. Email is a notoriously insecure medium of communication yet XXXX XXXX allowed and offered to receive the documents via email, despite the fact that it was against Scottrade Bank 's internal policies and does not have any of the normal safeguards in place to handle personal customer information. The XXXX XXXX, 2013 email contained PDF attachments that included my full name, signature, address, bank account numbers, Social Security Number, and other very personal and sensitive information. 

As is clear by Scottrade 's online disclosures and policies, Scottrade Bank states that it will never transmit customer information over email and or ask for or receive personal information via email, however, XXXX XXXX, a manager at Scottrade encouraged me to send the information by email to expedite the process, with no disclose of the security concerns. 

I am writing today to ask Scottrade to explain why they let my personal information be transmitted in a way that puts me at significant risk to identity theft. I would also like to know what the current status of the email and personal information is, has it been deleted, has it been accessed, are emails records secure, who could have gained access, was the email accessed via HTTP or HTTPS, was it confirmed a secure connection? 

The actions of XXXX XXXX, put me at my personal information at risk and could have likely been the direct cause for hackings that happened weeks latter and accounted for over XXXX of fraud.

All required paperwork was provided in a timely manner by both myself and the buyer. Everything moved along smoothly with the appraisal and inspection.

When I inquired my realtor if the closing on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was confirmed he stated that BB & T did n't indicate a delay but he would check, he later stated that BB & T drop the ball and the closing is delayed without an expected date. 
I contacted the MLO XXXX XXXX in regarfs to payment as it was due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the scheduled closing date, she stated to just wait as surely we would close in just a few days. Fortunately I decided to make a payment to avoid a late fee since a closing date was not provided. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX a new closing date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was set. At XXXX XXXX on the night before the closing, I received an email from the realtor copying the MLO email stating that paperwork was n't ready and she was sorry for "" the mess ''.

2112,2016-04-08,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account terms,"Good Morning, I am currently on someone else 's account with XXXX. I inquired with XXXX to have my own account so that I can start building credit after having been hit with Identity Theft and having it cleared. After speaking with XXXX they said that it would be a Soft Inquiry and not a Hard Inquiry and it would be great for building credit. I said ok and they told me that they needed a special pin from Transunion as I have a credit freeze on all XXXX Credit Bureaus due to Identity Theft to gain access to my credit file. After getting a pin I would have to wait 72 hours before they could run my credit. After the 72 hours have passed I contacted XXXX so that we can start the process. They said that the pin did n't work and that I would need to contact Transunion to allow XXXX to gain access. I contacted Transunion who explained that the pin is fine. I called XXXX back and they said to see if I could get another pin, because the pin they have is n't working. I contacted Transunion to get another pin. I waited another 72 hours before contacting XXXX to try to get the change of responsibility up and running. XXXX told me that the pin still did n't work to again contact Transunion. After calling Transunion, they told me that they have given XXXX all the access that they needed and the only thing left is a XXXX XXXX for a certain amount of time. I said ok and contacted XXXX who said that I would have to wait another 72 hours before they can run my credit. The 72 hours passed again and they still could n't offer me my own account. XXXX told me to contact Transunion to find out why they are not allowing XXXX to gain access to my credit file. Transunion said they gave XXXX all they could and there 's nothing more to give access to that they have n't given already. After talking with XXXX they offered to go to another credit bureau to check my credit and I declined after what I dealt with already. I got an alert from XXXX that said that I got hit with XXXX Hard Inquiries from XXXX for XXXX separate dates when I was specifically told that it would be a Soft Inquiry once to begin with. If I would have known it would be a Hard Inquiry from the start I would have said no to the change of responsibility. I called XXXX to request to have the inquiries removed in which they said they ca n't be removed by them, but to contact Transunion to have it removed. I called Transunion requesting the inquiries be removed, but they told me that they would need a letter from me requesting the inquiries be removed as well as a letter from XXXX on company letter head or an email. I got an email from XXXX requesting the inquiries be removed and I typed a letter which I immediately sent to Transunion so the inquires can be removed, but Transunion needed the dates the inquiries hit my credit file to be in the email. I typed up a revise of my letter to send via fax and I asked XXXX to revise the email with the dates that they sent me and that it should be sufficient enough. XXXX claims that they ca n't send emails like that and that I would just have to wait for the inquires to fall off or contact Transunion and file a dispute. I was giving incorrect information when I said every step of the way I did n't want any Hard Inquiries due to having had Identity Theft and that I was in the process of building credit. This is affecting me greatly as I was on the path of obtaining a house, but with these Hard Inquires that dream wo n't happen until it is removed.

I had some American Express credit card debt which was then sent out to a third party, XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I have been making monthly payments consistently with XXXX. This month, they offered me to elect to join the CARE program, which purports to be a monthly payment program which will alter my interest rates on the debt. They told me some of the terms on the phone. It sounded like they were offering to waive all late payments, but they said that the terms might change if I did not make my payments on time, so I was suspicious. I asked the people at XXXX XXXX if I could get a written disclosure either digitally or in writing that contained the terms of the payment program. They told me they could not send me the terms until I agreed to join the program. I told them multiple times I did not want to sign up for anything without reading the terms, and they told me they could not send me the terms until I was in the program and kept stressing to me that I might not continue to be eligible for the program if I did n't sign up today. I told them I 'd think about it and get back to them and they continued to stress that I might lose eligibility for the program if I did n't sign up today and agree to a number of agreed monthly payments ( which were higher than my current minimum payment ). 

I told them no, and when I transferred back to make my monthly payment, I was asked to verify the amount I would like to make in my monthly payments. I told the representative I would only like to make one payment, and they finally backed off. 

It feels bizarre that they offered to change the terms of my underlying debt but would n't give me a written disclosure of the terms of the agreement. 

I posted about this on reddit, and asked other folks to comment if they 've had the same problem. That 's here : XXXX",,Amex,TX,782XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-07-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2015231

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a XXXX on the house that we live right now from MSHL in the amount of {$200000.00}. Of course this was a line of credit for that amount. We used this loan throughout the years of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/2010 when this loan matured. ( It was a ten year line of credit loan. ) After XX/XX/XXXX, we continued making payment and started talking to MSHL about our options. Meanwhile we continued making our payment during those couple of years past the maturity of the loan. In XX/XX/XXXX MSHL sent us a refinancing loan package to refinance this loan. After reviewing the loan package, we realized that the loan amount is much higher than what we were expecting the loan balance to be. So we told them that we are not interested to refinance and we would like to pay off this loan. We sent them a qualified letter and requesting that they give us a complete loan history. This was in preparation to payoff this loan. MSHL as soon as receiving our certified letter they transferred the loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. ( A collection company ). Ever since we are asking XXXX and MSHL for a complete loan history, they are not giving us the complete loan history. And we have not heard back from MSHL any more. We would like to demand MSHL to give us a complete loan history so we can pay off the correct loan amount. Secondly, if they can not give us a complete loan history, we are willing and already have fund to pay this loan. But we should not pay the interest that they are demanding us to pay for the past three years. We have gathered funds and kept it in a saving account for the past three years and collecting almost no interest, and the current collection company for MSHL, XXXX is demanding from us to pay the interest for the past three years. I believe that MSHL can not produce the complete accounting of our loan. Secondly we have learn through news and received a small check from a class action law suite against them that they have mis managed people 's fund and loan documents. So we believe we deserve to have a complete accounting of this loan before paying it. 
Also I have to emphasize that we have always kept the payment of this loan current. They refused to accept our payment, right after we requested the accounting of the loan. We have documentation to support all our statements above. We also received correspondences from this other company XXXX which is also related to MSHL company. Also I have to inform you that we did file a separate complaint against XXXX XXXX servicing company. XXXX is the company that has the note at this point. The XXXX XXXX XXXX claims that they are a debt collection company. The case number with CFPB for the XXXX is XXXX. The XXXX did respond to that complaint. They claim that they are giving us all the information that they have. Of course it does not go back to the date of origination of the loan. So not only their response to that complaint is not satisfactory but also there are some conflicting number. We are going to respond to their inadequate explanation. Meanwhile we are filing this complaint against MSHL or the XXXX company to get a full report of our funds.

I have had XXXX contacts with Quicken loans since I obtained that letter on XX/XX/XXXX. Quicken did the research and has come back with an excuse that they did in fact make an error at closing but refuse to cover the {$900.00} plus dollars the future tax lien would be for. Quicken then takes my already escrowed taxes for XX/XX/XXXX and pays taxes for XX/XX/XXXX before I even purchased the home! The Quicken team member and her manager XXXX indicated that the closing team made an error and then put a notified credit on the buyer 's side of the HUD and lessened my closing costs. Quicken also admittedly indicated they did NOT disclose any of this to us at closing, no disclosures, no additional escrow, no payment for past due taxes. They are now threatening default on my property for an error they acknowledge they made. I advised them I would not be covering this, I escalated it as high as I could with the Quicken staff, and they refuse to move forward with remedying the error. 
This is predatory lending XXXX and violation of RESPA knowing I was already tight on closing money coming in, they chose to hide this from me, and never notify me until I found out. They refuse to provide a disclosures or signed documents specifically speaking to the past due taxes, extra escrow, or required payment.

My client owns a home on which he has an outstanding mortgage obligation - amount currently due is approx. {$440000.00}. The mortgage Servicer is Nationstar Mortgage LLC ( XXXX, XXXX ). Despite our efforts to obtain a mortgage modification, we have encountered extreme difficulty in dealing with Nationstar, the mortgage servicer. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my client submitted HAMP paperwork in order to apply for a modification ( previously, paperwork had been submitted on numerous occasions, but on each such occasion, Nationstar denied the application due to an alleged document deficiency ). Through our XX/XX/XXXX submission, Nationstar finally acknowledged our completed submission. By all accounts, my client should rightly qualify for a mortgage modification - his current mortgage outstanding ( including interest and fees ) is approx. {$440000.00} and my client earns in excess of $ XXXX / per annum. Furthermore, my client carries little to no additional consumer debt ( no car loan, little to no credit card debt, no student loans, etc. ). Despite this, in XXXX XXXX, Nationstar notified my office that my client 's mortgage modification application was being denied, due to various reasons, each of which was inaccurate and/or nebulous and without grounding in actual fact. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I filed a formal Appeal Letter with Nationstar in order to dispute its modification application denial, and in so doing, raised a number of questions and attached key supporting documents. To date, Nationstar and its counsel have failed to the substantive questions that I raised through the XXXX XXXX, XXXX Appeal Letter. These questions included, but were not limited to, inquiries on : ( i ) the ostensible owner / holder of the Note ( Nationstar is only the Servicer ) ; ( ii ) the additional expenses per DOJ guidelines used by Nationstar in bolstering its assertion that my client has negative debt to income due to various expenses ; ( iii ) a complete list of all expenses and corresponding amounts used by Nationstar when conducting its HAMP analysis as to my client 's eligibility for a potential modification ; ( iv ) a complete copy of my client 's Loan File ; ( v ) language in either the MHA Handbook or Nationstar 's Servicer Participation Agreement which arguably allows Nationstar to deny my client for a HAMP Tier II modification by unilaterally rejiggering the interest rate as though the ARM loan was current. At this stage, the situation calls for immediate oversight and assistance from the CFPB - earlier today, my client received a Notice of Sale in his mail from Nationstar 's counsel indicating a foreclosure sale has been set for XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I have advised my client of his XXXX ( XXXX ) statutorily mandated sale adjournments of two ( 2 ) weeks each. Thank you in advance for your time and attention.

From a cursory search of the internet, after experiencing PNC's practices on auto-pay, the victim found links about disproportionate complaints related to PNC.

The victim further learned that PNC settled claims with the XXXX
XXXX.	The victim did not actively seek to become a customer of PNC. Rather, PNC purchased his mortgage from another company. PNC chose its victim.
XXXX	The victim has a XXXX. XXXX which sheds light on acceptable defaults for people who are likely to experience inertia such as those on auto-pay, described below. Based on the victim's understanding XXXX, he is in a good position to realize that PNC's scheme is likely to cause massive errors and financial problems for thousands mortgage holders.
XXXX	PNC Mortgage acquired the victim's fixed-rate 15-year mortgage at 2.75% from another lender in XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage - which had been repurchased numerous times over the loan life (which began in XX/XX/XXXX) - had been on auto-payment from the victim's bank account from inception. The victim has an outstanding credit history and has never missed a mortgage payment. Every mortgage lender until PNC had continued the auto-payment that the victim initially set up from inception when it acquired the loan. The victim has never defaulted on any loan.
XXXX	Unbeknownst to the victim (who is working in XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX and commuting home on weekends), when PNC purchased the mortgage, it deliberately discontinued the auto-pay feature that had been in force since XX/XX/XXXX.
XXXX	Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, no funds for the mortgage were withdrawn from the victim's bank account because PNC cancelled the auto-pay feature. The victim was unaware of this.
XXXX	PNC sent non-descript notices to the victim's home during XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. No phone calls were made to the victim's cellphone. No phone calls were made to the victim's work number. No emails were sent to the victim's email. No letters requiring a signature were sent to the victim's home address that would have alerted the victim or his wife of the pending problem. No courier was sent.
XXXX	During a weekend visit home, on SaturdayXX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX EST, the victim discovered, by accident, the loan was delinquent. The victim was looking for a utility bill for his short-term rental in XXXX.
XXXX. Attempts to contact PNC during the rest of the weekend were futile. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX, the victim called PNC at XXXX. The call lasted for XXXX minutes, during which time the victim spoke with four PNC representatives, before being forwarded to a voicemail. Every representative attempted to give the victim a run-around or blame him (i.e., alluding to the welcome letter). XXXX representative overtly lied about how to set-up autopay online, and refused to pay postage to set up autopay through the mail.
XXXX The computer glitches that made it impossible to set up autopay on XX/XX/XXXX were resolved on XX/XX/XXXX
XXXX The key problem is that PNC purchases mortgages with autopay from customers who voluntarily chose that convenience. They then cancel auto-pay, blame the victim, and potentially harm thousands of customers with late fees and distress.
XXXX. The victim asks the CFPB to investigate how many victims are harmed by PNC's internal choices, and force PNC to address the issue and compensate the victims.",,PNC Bank N.A.,KY,405XX,,Consent provided,Web,2015-06-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1444456

The closing date comes, and Prospect has n't funded my loan. This is after they confirmed to us we were good to close. Then they come back and say the closing attorney is n't approved. So the attorney fills out paperwork and submits it. Then they say that can take up to several days. 

The XXXX, still no closing. The XXXX, no closing, so I emailed their consumer advocate. This seemed to get the ball rolling, although I never sensed any sort of urgency on their part. We closed on tuesday, the XXXX. 

Because of the missed closing date, I had to rent XXXX storage units and move XXXX, once to storage and from storage to my new house. I had to stay in a motel for XXXX nights. I had to throw away food I had no way to keep since storage units do n't have electricity for refrigeration. I lost time away from work.

I did submit almost XXXX dollars worth. Never during the process did the branch manager call me to apologize, or give me any indication that he was even concerned or involved. The processor that did my loan was fired, and the loan officer resigned, because they ca n't seem to meet closing dates. The branch manager, XXXX, refuses to reimburse me. He did n't even apologize except through email after his manager brought it to his attention.

Also the letter referenced above and attached states remove the account ending in XXXX but my daughter and the credit bureau did not receive a letter to remove the newly created account number. The account that belongs to me was removed from my credit file and remained on my daughter 's credit file. This is causing a major problem because she was in the process of applying for a mortgage. So I am dealing with Wells Fargo associating my name with my daughter 's Social Security Number and I am getting pushed around from department to department, customer service reps in call centers that just read notes. Switching Social Security numbers is a serious issue that is now affecting us both. I am asking for Wells Fargo to first correct the social security number problem that was created by them ; get the account back in my social security number and have the credit bureau remove my daughter 's name from everything associated with this account which is what Wells Fargo said they would do.

First of all - this was over 10 years ago. I did try to short sale the property. You denied taking the money. Not Green Tree but XXXX, XXXX, XXXX now yourselves are trying to do something. 

You can attempt to collect this debt all day long but KNOW that you will not receive one dime. You denied taking the money first off - you sold it at the sheriff sale for MUCH more then it was worth - over {$210000.00} - so you received money from your insurance division for the difference, then you sold it for {$190000.00} so your establishment made more money then this debt was to begin with ... so why continue to try to collect when you made too much money??? 

Funny how you banks were bailed out taking all of our hard earned money to support your rich habits. All banks make so much money it is crazy - thats all you see these days new banks everywhere. You should have never been bailed out by our government. Our government should be abolished so us Americans can live. Land of the Free - with all these banks taking advantage of every American up until 2 years ago - where loan officers could do anything in their power to rip off innocent people and continue to do so - but at least not they are regulated it still is a scary deal. 

As you can see I am XXXX - I did purchase properties but had no clue that these loans were fraudulent until after the fact!!! Title could not explain the type of loan that was in writing. Interest only loan - XXXX with a cap - but XXXX did not see the mortgage documentation or the note attached. There was a cap but they continued to raise the interest rate - EVEN when the interest rate was not raising!!! How is this right?? 

Banks continue to try to modify loans WITHOUT a loan officers license ... SCARY!!!!!! the CEOs of many banks took our money from the government and ran away. Funny how that worked. 

Anyway - YES I HAVE COMPLAINTS about how all mortgages were handled back in the day of NO LIcensure for loan officers. Steal from the poor to give to the rich!! Thats our government!!! And it continues every single day of our lives. Politicians are all crooks and continue to be - NO COMMON SENSE OUT THERE AT ALL!! 

I see people from other countries coming here to AMERICA and receiving SOCIAL SECURITY benefits and have NEVER WORKED A DAY IN OUR COUNTRY. What the flip is that all about???? They get money handed to them BUT OUR AMERICANS have to fight for their money! Hard earned money that they contributed too and can not receive. Thats our government yet again taking advantage of Americans. Hungry children in our country get no assistance again because government sends our money to everyone else but US!!! 

Thats it for now - enjoy your day!! Share this email with everyone out there that needs to know how our government really is and no one will do anything about it!! SO SAD!!!!

2446,2016-06-10,Credit card,,Other,,"Three times over the past several months I have made payment on my Synchronicity Bank/Sam 's Club Mastercard account, and the issuing bank has delayed posting available credit on the account for 7 days despite clearly stated policy on their website that credit for payments will be granted within 48 hours. The website states that it may take up to 48 hours for payments to post to an account, and offers no information about why credit may be withheld for a longer period of time. The cardholder agreement states ( in the section titled "" When Payments are Due '' ), "" We may delay making credit available on your account in the amount of your payment even though we will credit your payment when we receive it. '' In my opinion this is a vague statement, and it is in a section of the Account Agreement that it does not even relate to ( When Payments are Due ). 

In each instance I called customer service to inquire about the delay. In each instance I was given a different reason for the bank 's decision to withhold available credit, including 1 ) making two payments during a billing cycle in the same amount indicates possible fraud ( I did this while on business travel because the account was nearing it 's limit ) ; 2 ) making two payments in any amount during the same billing period indicates possible fraud ( I did this near the end of a billing cycle because the balance was nearing its limit and I wanted to continue using the card ) ; 3 ) making a single large payment indicates possible fraud ( I simply paid off the balance of the account a couple days into a new billing cycle ). 

For as long as I have had this account, I have never been late on a payment, I have never had a payment returned due to insufficient funds, and I have always paid off the entire balance before the end of the billing cycle. I have been harmed by this policy due to the fact that I have certain bills ( medical insurance premiums, in particular ), that I had planned to pay using the available credit on this account, however the credit was not made available within 48 hours as stated by the website when payment was made, and I had no other funds available to pay these bills in a timely manner.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Synchrony Financial,WA,980XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-06-16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1963347

The problem is that they post the fee on the first day of the new period, the day after they send out the statement for the period for which the fee is levied. This means that their customers checking balance is {$5.00} less than the customers expect, and for those customers who live on the edge, might result in hefty overdraft charges. I believe that sticking those unfortunate customers with those onerous overdraft charges as a result of a month long delay in notification of a {$5.00} service fee is the exactly what the bank intended.

Beginning last year the mortgage company began to hold my ex-husband 's payments if they were not paid on time until the second month was paid up to date. This year 2016, I fell behind on my payments in XXXX, in hopes that I would have XXXX 's payment before XXXX XXXX, 2016 I held XXXX 's payment. On XXXX/XXXX/16 a delinquency notice was sent to me stating I owed both XXXX and XXXX 's payment along with late charges and an NSF fee. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I sent a payment of the amount due less a {$200.00} credit that I have with the mortgage company in a non applied account. On that same day, another delinquency notice was sent stating that I owed XXXX and XXXX 's payment along with late charges and an NSF fee, which was post dated XXXX XXXX, 2016. Please note, that on these delinquency notices it states "" ALL PAYMENTS ARE DUE ON THE XXXX OF EACH MONTH ; THERE IS A 15 DAY GRACE PERIOD BEFORE A LATE CHARGE IS ASSESSED. PAYMENTS MUST BE IN THE OFFICE BY XXXX. ON THE XXXX!!! IF THE XXXX FALLS ON SATURDAY OR SUNDAY, THE PAYMENT MUST BE IN OUR OFFICE ON THE FRIDAY PRIOR TO THE XXXX BY XXXX P.M.!! '' On XXXX/XXXX/16, I received a call from XXXX at XXXX Mortgage telling me she received my payment for XXXX and XXXX but would not be able to apply the payment until XXXX 's payment was received since XXXX was now considered late. When I explained to her that I had until the XXXX of the month she stated that I did not have that grace period and that she was going to send the payment back since I did not have a date of when I would be able to make XXXX 's payment. I then asked to speak to her supervisor and was immediately transferred to XXXX. He then reiterated what XXXX had stated and I asked him to send me a copy of the signed contract and highlight where it states that they will not accept my payments. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I sent Lake Mortgage XXXX 's payment which then would have brought my account up to date. On that same day Lake Mortgage sent me a copy of my signed contract along with my first check, refusing my XXXX and XXXX 's payment. On XXXX XXXX they then returned my XXXX 's payment stating that they would not accept one payment when three payments were due and also placed in the letter that they did not accept a personal check when XXXX payment are due ; only money order, cashier 's check or certified check. If they had not sent my first payment back for XXXX and XXXX I would not have been behind three months since I had until the XXXX at XXXX p.m. to get my XXXX 's payment in their office. I paid exactly what their bill stated minus my {$200.00} over payment that they hold in some fund that does not get applied to the principal or collect interest on. So because they refused my payments I am now behind three months, I was not able to get my payments to them in time by certified, cashier 's check or money order. I am not located in the state where the mortgage company is so this has been all done by US mail. I know that they are adding interest on the unpaid principal and when they sent me my signed contract it states they have the option to accept late payments. This company several times as collected additional interest on our payments because they have held payments due to the next month 's due date being close. I have had this mortgage company since XXXX and last year was the first time they held our payments until the next months payment was paid.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Lake Mortgage Company Inc.,WA,986XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-07-14,Closed,Yes,No,1934703

2619,2015-06-18,Credit card,,Closing/Cancelling account,,"This request for assistance from the CFPB and JP Morgan Chase is being submitted based upon the fact pattern presented, in pertinent part, below. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a mail solicitation from JP Morgan Chase 's Slate branded credit card program ( hereinafter, "" Slate '' ) to apply for their credit card. The solicitation offered several strong inducements to apply for the card, including the transfer of existing credit balances at other companies with a 0 % interest rate for 15 months. 

Upon receipt of my application in XXXX, XXXX ran my credit background and approved the card. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX provided an email notification that the "" new card was on the way. '' Indeed, it was received shortly thereafter. XXXX also offered to increase the credit balance, based upon my good credit history. In reliance upon their offer, I transferred balances that I held at other companies to the card, which I understood included a percentage fee surcharge for the transfer. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, without provocation, I received a letter from the XXXX program that they would be cancelling the card in XX/XX/XXXX. No reason was provided, other than "" reputational risk. '' Representatives from XXXX could give no further information, but did indicate that such letters are sometimes issued when there is rapid credit utilization on a card. 

However, XXXX of the prime reasons for obtaining the card was in fact *precisely* to utilize the credit in order to apply the favorable rate of financing advertised. It now seems that because I utilized this offer as advertised, the offer and the card are being cancelled. 

Curiously, I received another email ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) indicating that my "" ... enhanced Chase XXXX card is on the way ... '' The revocation of the card seems arbitrary, unwarranted, and creates hardships as a sizable balance must now be once again transferred -- likely back to the original institution. Moreover, the actions have the potential to create material harm in the form of "" unnecessary '' transactions in my credit report ( performing the initial credit check, increasing the balance, and then cancelling the card within a short time frame, with no exhibition of inability to pay, or defaults of any kind ). 

XXXX 

I respectfully submit this request for review and assistance in investigating the matter further. 

Very Truly Yours

2620,2015-04-17,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"A few years ago I filed a complaint with FCC and fraudulent billing from XXXX XXXX. They were caught XXXX billing my account more then XXXX times. XXXX XXXX closed my account and issued me a refund and refunded all deposits. A XXXX later I started to receive bills from other companies over a {$99.00} charge. This charge was not accurate. I should never have been charged additional months when the account was closed and I was with another company. In addition, if I owned them money, why would n't they deduct the charges from the XXXX dollars that they over billed for. 

I filed complaints and I thought the issue was resolved, until 3 weeks ago. I found the "" charge-off '' from XXXX XXXX on my credit report. Today, I was surprised by a letter from Jefferson Capital Systems LLC stating they are taking over my XXXX XXXX account. There is XXXX reference to the amount on the account numbered : XXXX. 

1. I do not owe XXXX XXXX any money because my account was settled in full and I was issued a reimbursement for their XXXX billing. 
2. If this bill has already been listed as a "" charge-off '' how can another company take ownership over the account? 
3. I have already had my credit destroyed because I had the mistake of working with XXXX XXXX. They retaliated against me because I filed several complaints. 

XXXX XXXX has violeted my Fair Credit Report Act protection.

I asked that they stop any and all contact with me until after my dispute has been investigated and they have provided proof of the debt in writing to me. Even after sending this letter within the 30 days of when I received their notice, they continue to call me multiple times per day. My understanding is that according to the provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) they must cease contacting me until they have provided competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay them. In my mind, Southwest Credit is clearly in violation of the 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) of the FDCPA.

We understand that a Bank can charge a small fee for a Modification, but Wells Fargo paid themselves XXXX for administration fees, they stole XXXX from the Federal Government and from us, in this usual trick of theirs. Wells Fargo called the help Keep Your Home California gave us a Modification. According to Keep Your Home it was not a Modification and that now I can apply for the Principal Reduction and Modification. Wells Fargo is now in the process of selling our Loan to another Bank. They approved sending us the documents for Principal reduction and Home Modification we requested but reneged on us saying to ask for this Principal reduction and Modification from the future new Mortgage Holder. Wells Fargo has caused us to suffer a great deal with worrying, despairing, sleepless nights etc ... We are XXXX years old and Wells Fargo has not shown one iota of cooperation. If anything the total opposite. We can bear their injustice no more. One last thing, Wells Fargo forced us to pay twice for the month of XXXX, 2014.

The reason we have PMI in the XXXX place, is that my wife & I got buried in our house ( at that time ) in XXXX, which we bought at the top of the market in XXXX, XXXX. That + relocating cross country to XXXX + switching jobs to be closer to family put us in a financial bind which we 've worked hard to dig out of. So, we did not have the 20 % down payment to put down on our current redidence in XXXX. We purchased our current home XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Both my wife & I have excellent credit. We were overjoyed to discover how the values in our neighborhood have sky-rocketed ( due in part to a brand new XXXX school ), but were told by R.C.S that we had to wait until we were in our home for XXXX years ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) before we could apply to lose the P.M.I. So, we did. I never thought I 'd say that I found a company that makes XXXX 's customer service look good, but with R.C.S, that sad fact came to be. We have been writing letters & making phone calls since right before we hit the 2 year point of ownership in early XXXX ( almost 6 months now ). We paid {$470.00} to have an appraisal done, and then the "" R.C.S run-around '' started in earnest. Our house, after a XXXX errors ( including choice of comparables & year it was built, which triggered at least XXXX unsuitable comp ) was appraised at {$290000.00}. All we needed was an appraisal in the low XXXX 's to remove P.M.I completely. Had we not lost a small fortune with our house in XXXX and were we not shouldering the P.M.I to the tune of {$250.00} / month, his XXXX appraisal might have been good news. But our realtor quickly produced XXXX comps "" averaging '' {$320000.00}, which I forwarded to R.C.S. Then the exact same model home as ours, built a year apart from ours, located less than XXXX block away ... sold for {$330000.00} ... a full {$45000.00} more than the R.C.S appraiser appraised our house for! 
The appraiser, XXXX XXXX, told me that he 'd gladly reconsider with the new comps, but we needed to go through XXXX. When I followed up with him over a month after I 'd re-submitted them to R.C.S, he told me he never even received the ( more accurate ) comps from R.C.S! Now R.C.S reps say that we have to pay another $ XXXX to have yet another appraisal done. Whatever happened to "" owning up to one 's own work ... or even mistakes ''?! XXXX of their managers, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, indicated to my wife that she would work with us ( over a month ago ) so we rushed down to the XXXX store and paid to have the ( accurate ) comps faxed to her personally ( even though R.C.S had had them since XXXX XXXX! But we believed her. Then ... no word at all from XXXX XXXX ... no return calls ... no response to several messages. I 'm embarrassed as to how mad I 've gotten talking to some of their representatives. All we want is a fair appraisal ( which we 've already paid more than market rate for ) so we can write R.C.S a check ( if need be ) to meet the "" remaining '' required 80 % loan to value ratio, and to end our savings account being hit for {$250.00} every month ( for nothing ).

2818,2015-09-12,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"On XXXX XXXX of 2015, I called the Customer Service Phone Number for Citizens Bank in Rhode Island because I noticed a {$35.00} overdraft fee that did not seem appropriate. Specifically, the fee was assessed on XXXX/XXXX/15 for check # XXXX in the amount of {$220.00}. I feel the fee is unfair because the check was only processed by the bank on XXXX/XXXX/15 when funds were sufficient. According to XXXX and XXXX from Citizens ' "" New Mexico Phone Banking Department '', the fee was assessed because funds were insufficient on the day before ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ). I expressed to these representatives that, as a factor of dealing many times with Citizens and overdrafts in the past, we were closely watching for notifications of transactions on the evening of XXXX/XXXX/15. This is because we 've been told innumerable times by Citizens ' customer service representatives that, as long as we watch the online activity and ensure funds are sufficient by XXXX of each day, we will not incur any overdraft fees in the future. To be clear, there have been no notifications of transactions that caused our account to fall below zero dollars from the morning of XXXX/XXXX/15 up through to the present time which is XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX. In addition, I informed XXXX that we would have transferred money from our XXXX account ( via ATM 's ) if a notification had appeared online. Moreover, I even checked my account the morning of XXXX/XXXX/15 before going into school and nothing about this transaction was evident online. When I expressed this information to XXXX, the Supervisor, he then told me that "" online banking is only a tool for customers '' and that it can not be completely relied upon for accuracy. This contradicts what I 've been told every single time I get an overdraft fee ( and it happens all the time honestly ) ; in fact, I was told this just within the last week or so when I incurred a different, unrelated overdraft fee. XXXX further declined to grant a reversal of the fee on the basis that they have been gracious enough with reversals in recent past encounters. I explained that the other transactions were irrelevant because this situation is unique, but he was not persuaded to help me. I feel that since funds were sufficient when the bank did process the check, an overdraft fee is just inappropriate, unfair, greedy, and overly punitive. Moreover, I 'd like to know if I am one of the bank 's customers from whose deposits they stole money over the last couple years. If so, this means I 'm going to be receiving money back from them in a lump sum. Depending on the amount to be returned, this could also mean that perhaps some or all of the overdraft fees incurred during this time period should be reversed in my favor. I also think it 's important that this same courtesy be given to every one of the customers from whom it stole money, along with a hand-written letter of apology. Please do what you can to help me as I am in XXXX XXXX and trying to keep bread on my table. I have only {$4.00} to my name right now as a consequence of this fee, and I may consider suing Citizens for emotional distress as well if this is not solved expediently.

I then called XXXX and gave them the police report information. I was then told on XXXX XXXX 2015 that XXXX sent Bank of America a demand letter. On XXXX XXXX XXXX did a follow up with Bank Of America and Bank of America stated an expected date of completion would be XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me they closed the claim due it being beyond the 120 days that they had to work on this claim. I called Bank of America and all they would tell me is that they denied the claim with XXXX. If this matter is not resolved I am going to follow through with a lawyer and sue for this amount plus more. This has cause me to have to move and put a lot of stress on me after I gave birth to my son.

These transactions ( one for {$1600.00}, the other for {$70.00} ) both cleared on the same day resulting in an overdraft for which the charge was {$34.00}. That seems high, since it was the XXXX instance since opening the account about fourteen months ago. Inquiring if an overdraft protection procedure was available, i learned that another checking account could not be used since the other account was a commercial account, but that a savings account would serve this purpose. No mention was made of any charges involved. It took about a week to get a savings account established, and to see how it would work, I again over drafted the personal account. It worked fine, but resulted in a {$13.00} charge for the service. This seems unreasonable. My sense of these transactions is they both were driven by software without any human effort required, which makes me think I 'm paying for service that I 'm not getting.

2903,2016-05-21,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"XXXX I opened the Citi Gold Checking account through a promotion offering XXXX XXXX XXXX miles. I completed the application using the appropriate promo code and took screenshots throughout the entire process detailing the promotional offer and the rules concerning it. I had to spend {$1000.00} on the debit card and complete XXXX bill pays within three months. 

After the application was approved and I had created my online access, I sent a secure message to confirm that the promotional offer was indeed attached to my account and to reconfirm the promo rules. The secure message agent at Citi confirmed the promotional offer for the XXXX miles was attached to my account. A few days later I chatted with a Citi agent to check on the progress of my promotion and what I had completed so far. Again I was assured the promotional offer was attached to my account and I was told I had charged a few XXXX dollars to the debit card and had completed XXXX bill pay. After completing the requirements XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another secure message to Citi to inquire how long it would take for the miles to post. I was told by this agent the following : "" I have submitted an investigation to confirm you have completed the required behaviors and qualify for the miles to be awarded to you. '' I then received a communication from Citi saying, essentially, I would not be getting the miles. This was despite the fact that several agents had told me otherwise, and despite the fact that I have screenshots of my application process proving I correctly applied using the promo code. 

Since then the service at Citi has been pretty poor. I continue to get canned responses and no specific reasons as to why the offer wo n't be honored. Agents have assured me a follow-up investigation was opened, but it has been over two weeks since that happened and I have gotten no response. I feel I am being taken advantage of. Had I known Citi would not honor the promotional offer I applied through, I would have left my money in another savings account earning higher interest. 

To top it off, my wife applied for the exact same promo offer on the exact same day and completed the requirements in the exact same time period and she has already received her bonus miles. So there is clearly something wrong on Citi 's end. 

I would really appreciate some real help with this issue. I feel like Citi is not giving that to me, and is not holding up the bargain.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Citibank,FL,331XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-05-21,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,1935565

2962,2016-03-23,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Problem with statement of dispute,"Overview of Problem -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Despite providing clear and convincing evidence that proves beyond any doubt that I paid a lien in XXXX XXXX, TransUnion will not change my credit report to reflect the correct payment date. 


Details -- -- -- - I paid a State Department of Revenue ( SDOR ) state tax lien in full XXXX XXXX. 

The SDOR failed to report the payment to the County Superior Court ( CSC ) for recording until XXXX XXXX, over 2 years late. 

Because the CSC records the release date as the date the SDOR transmits the information, the public record reports the release date as XXXX XXXX. 

After the release was filed in XXXX XXXX, I requested the CSC record a corrected document stating the proper release date of XXXX XXXX. 

The CSC would not record a corrected release, so I requested help from the SDOR commissioner in correcting this error. The SDOR was successful in getting the CSC to add a notation to the official record that the payment was made in XXXX XXXX, but the CSC still would not refile the release with the correct date. 

I submitted a request to TransUnion that this be changed on my credit report. The result stated that the item was reporting correctly and thus was not removed. The notation made by the CSC was evidently not enough proof. 

In XXXX, I wrote to the new SDOR commissioner. This resulted in the local XXXX providing a signed letter stating that the improper recording date was not my fault, and that I paid the full amount in XXXX XXXX. 

I again submitted a dispute to TransUnion. TransUnion responded again that the item was reporting correctly. The letter from SDOR, the creditor, stating the correct payment date was not accepted as proof of the release date. 

To recap, the CSC may be the reporting agency, but they are NOT the party to which the money was owed. In the mind of the CSC, they are reporting the item correctly. However, the party to which the money was owed, the SDOR, confirms payment was made in full in XXXX XXXX. The SDOR also acknowledges it did not transmit the payoff information to the County Superior Court ( CSC ) in a timely manner for recording. In fact, it was over 2 years late. 

Therefore, this item 's payment date should be reflected correctly on my credit report. If so, it will be well past the seven year threshold for removal. 

Companies that wield as much power over consumers as does TransUnion should be held to an extremely high standard. In my opinion, the company falls well below such a standard. They have not gone beyond a cursory check of public records to examine the evidence I 've provided and report this item correctly in my credit file. This practice is resulting in derogatory information on my credit report which should not be included. 

The SDOR has attempted to help me twice to correct their error. I want TransUnion to do the right thing and correct my report. 

Documents uploaded for reference : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 ) Official check for payment 2 ) 'Release of State Tax Execution ' updated with correct payment date 3 ) Letter from SDOR stating correct payment date

Documents proffered by Schachter Portnoy LLC are insufficient to validate the alleged debt. They have worked to committed fraud by preparing and submitting false documents to this court with the intention that this court and I rely on the false documents to the detriment of me. ( See attached pdf file XXXXSet ) They are doing this to many others as well have made XXXX.Their whole case is based on the inability of people to afford and/or be given the right to an attorney to defend such law suits. They also base their cases on defendants going into default and/or not filing answers and/or inability to understand their rights as well as such proceedings. 

They filed lawsuits during holidays XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX with the intent their tactics are that defendants do n't know how to and/or can not respond in time. I filed answer to the complaint and a response to their request for admissions to the best of my abilities. And at the same time I responded to admissions I requested production of documents, admissions, and/or interrogatories. Their response was they did not receive it and/or the same tactics as to file a motion with no time to respond a few days prior to the current court date of XXXX XXXX 2015.

( see attached pdf pages PageSetXXXX ) ( Also see SetXXXX ) The fantasy that the debt-buyer system is keeping the cost of credit down evaporated when the bank decided to sell off the debt at a fraction of its face value. For example a {$1000.00} loan, which now includes an extra {$400.00} tacked on since the day the consumer stopped paying, will be sold for {$56.00}, the potential return on investment is 2,800 % ; {$56.00} invested and {$1600.00} returned.

Afterwards I contacted the collection agency ( enhanced recovery ). I told the representative the situation and he was asking was there anyone with the information needed to take out an account in my name. I responded yes and he said that he would start a fraud investigation. My loan officer contacted me on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and informed me that enhanced recovery had determined the account listed under my name was mine because the name and social on the account matched mine.

A few months after I started receiving letters from XXXX stating I had a outstanding bill. I explained that my account is still active that I only transferred my line and my account was current. I did n't hear anything else from them reference my bill. About 6 months later I started receiving mail from MIDLAND FUNDING stating they were attempting to collect a debt. I informed them that I still have verizon services and current with my bill. The rep stated that they 're only trying to recover the debt. I asked not to contacted any more about the account and would deal with XXXX myself. I tried several times to get someone at XXXX to find this mysterious bill with no luck. In XX/XX/XXXX I deployed and came back to more letters from MIDLAND FUNDING trying to collect the debt. They said I owed over {$300.00} but was willing to let me settle for a little over {$200.00}. So I gave in and just paid them because I can not allow any negative hits or collection on my report due to the nature of my job. I just recently sat down with my financial planner and on my Experian credit report there is a collection on there from MIDLAND FUNDING which I paid the settlement amount in XX/XX/XXXX. I 'm really upset at the fact that I paid a bill that no one could give me information about. MIDLAND FUNDING is being held accountable for placing this on my report and it does n't reflect that I paid their settlement offer. I tried to do the right thing by contacting XXXX in regards to the debt but no one can answer or find my information. I would like for MIDLAND FUNDING to remove that collection from my report because I do n't believe it was owed and I paid the settlement almost 3 years ago. This is negatively affecting my credit score and can effect my job security. I appreciate any assistance you can provide me.

This resulted in my being 60 days late without my knowledge. Once I was informed I immediately made payment to bring my account current. The following month in XXXX it was my understanding that my automatic payment process would be resumed, something I confirmed with the B of A representative over the phone as I was making arrangements to correct the balance on my account. I made my payment in XXXX to bring my account current as I negotiated with the representative over the phone and assumed that this mishap had been resolved. In XXXX I had pressing issues and I did not follow my balance with my account from which the payment should have been withdrawn. In XXXX I discovered that the payment had not been withdrawn and I immediately went to the bank and made a payment on XXXX XXXX that included late fee 's. The check cleared my bank XXXX XXXX, 2016. At that time, I was receiving calls from Bank of America demanding payment and reciprocating in the mail their pre-foreclosure packets. I called the B of A and was first informed that they had no record of my payment and that I had to make a payment with certified funds that day. I contacted a friend who is a Mortgage broker and we call Bank of America together. After several questions from my friend, Bank of America admitted that they had received my funds but returned them and that I had to make another payment with certified funds. This was XXXX/XXXX/2016. The spokesman told us that funds had been returned. On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I received the check with a letter from BofA that my funds were being returned. The check was dated XXXX/XXXX/2016, the envelope that the check was mailed in, however was dated XXXX/XXXX/2016. Bank of America waited another seven days to mail the check. Bank of America had accepted my funds, cashed the check, verified that they had indeed received the funds, then returned the funds and reported me late on my credit report and accelerated my loan into pre-foreclosure status. I am planning on taking B of A 's check to the bank and substituting it for a B of A certified check, and redepositing the funds back to ensure my loan does not go into foreclosure however I believe that Bank of America, by accepting my check, cashing my check, verifying that they had received the cash, and then returning the funds in favor of certified funds after receiving payment should be illegal. I further believe that while holding my funds, accelerating my account into their pre-foreclosure process is unconscionable. They held my funds and then charged me a penalty for being late, and accelerated my loan to pre-foreclosure status, even though they had verified that my funds had cleared and were in deed deposited into their account. Then took an additional week and a half to return the funds and only did so when I presented them with proof that they indeed were holding my funds.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Bank of America,CA,900XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-06-23,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,1982712

He said if this matter is continued to be ignored the legal matter will have to escalate. He then started asking me if we had a lot of attorneys or collection agencies call us. Or if we were filing for bankruptcy. I told him that this was not something I would comment on and I would pass his message along. He was really rude to me and said 'well, be sure you give my message this time. ' He said he would be in his office until XXXX today. "" This is completely unethical means of communication. Not only, was this phone call harassment it 's also slanderous for both the owner and the business. XXXX XXXX is not allowed to speak with anyone other than the owner about this matter. He should not disclose information or make slanderous accusation such as, "" [ do ] we have a lot of attorneys or collection agencies calling us. Or if we were filing for bankruptcy.

I only owe 14 years. The original loan was XXXX. I only wanted to refi the balance of XXXX. For 15 years. They took my XXXX. I gave them all the info requested. I have a credit score of XXXX/XXXX. They then need me to come in an sign a letter the mortgage person typed up. Stating that I live in my Condo. Bc I recently married. They had my husband fill out papers as cosigned when I do n't need it. They then asked for a 3 way call with my bank, I was 3 months ahead on my home loan in XXXX. Then they did it again fot a XXXX balance on my XXXX card. Then they had my husband do the same with his bank. Then they call us and make a offer for a higher interest rate then what we agreed on. A whole percent higher. Said they did n't believe I lived there. I said go there my clothes are there ask the management company. They refused and called me a liar. In fact she hung up on me. So I am out of the {$410.00} for the Loan. I can payoff the loan we have in money markets. But the unscubluous practice of Chase bank taking money and then changing the terms to get a higher rate is wrong and should be address. After thinking about it one day I went down to the front desk and asked our security do you keep records of my fob to get in and out of the building he said yes but he did n't know how far back it went. He went back to XXXX 2014. It shows every time I enter or left the building. He printed me a copy of my entrance and exits. I took them to my local bank and showed her and she said she would have the local manager call me. I got nothing from them. I called and left messages with the state of Fla area XXXX XXXX. He never returned my call. I would n't want a loan from them now if they gave it to me. I removed XXXX from my accounts there. And put it in my XXXX credit union.

On Monday the following week-XX/XX/2015, I went to a shop and my credit card was denied so I came back home and checked my accounts, I did not see the {$1200.00} that was supposed to be transferred back to my checking account and my credit card had been closed. I called them and they said they transferred the money back to my checking account XXXX mistakenly and this threw the credit card account over the limit and my credit card account was closed, the reason being that I went over the limit because the bank made a mistake and transferred {$1200.00} XXXX times back to my checking account instead of XXXX. I called the bank, they told me that they will reopen the credit card account and also request from the credit rating companies to nil of this incident from my credit history. To my surprise, I called this morning, I was told that it was my fault that they transferred {$1200.00} back XXXX into my checking account ; they said because I called XXXX and requested for the transferred back to my checking account and that they did that. 
I am feeling this complaint because I feel cheated out, embarrassed at the shop and felt like this is discriminatory. 
It was not my fault that a bank will make a double transfer when I was told that I was supposed to see the money in my account the next day and when I did not see it, I called back. The transfers did not show on my checking account until the next day-XX/XX/2015, so as at XX/XX/2015, I had no knowledge that such transfers were made.

3303,2015-12-16,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"Phh mortgage has made it very difficult for me once I fell behind on payments. Once a month they have a property preservation person come and say the house is vacant. I have called at least 12 times or more to tell them it is not vacant. All utilities are on and the lawn is cut or driveway plowed. I have now added a security system with signs on the lawn to keep them away. In XXXX XXXX XXXX of the property preservation people came and saw us cutting the hedges. In XXXX XXXX lawn equipment was stolen from the property including an expensive ladder, rake, and broom. The cast iron lawn furniture was dragged down the driveway to be stolen too. The front of my house has beautiful lilacs that overhang a flower bed on the side of the walkway and porch area. They were hacked and butchered into sharp raw stalks. XXXX ferns were stomped and broken. In the backyard the same sharp hatchet was used to cut wildflowers. The patch cut was just the same size as a cell phone camera lens. The preservation person must have said they mowed my acre of lawn and took a photo of the cutting to be paid for the work. I filed a police report which states the damage, but does not include the stolen items and the value of the damage is incorrect. The damage was so unusual I was frightened for my safety and my XXXX year old. The police officer stated that in 10 years on the force had he seen something like that. Under the advice of an attorney friend I was told to contact the bank to see if they might have done the damage. Phh confirmed they had been to the property the previous morning. I was told a supervisor would call back. It never happened. I called back the next day and Phh mortgage now said they could n't disclose such information. I again waited for a supervisor to call. In XXXX I called to try to make an {$8000.00} payment towards the {$11000.00} I owed. I was told that I should file again for a forbearance. The representative at Phh told me I pre-qualified for a forbearance and the {$11.00} could be paid at a later date also if I qualified. She sent out a packet and transferred me to a supervisor. The Supervisor noted I had called back in XXXX to complain about the damage and trespassing at my home. He said the XXXX phone calls were recorded but that even though every 3-5 weeks someone had been to the home that XXXX there was no record of someone being there. The documentation that proved they had been to my house suddenly vanished from the record. In XXXX the bank said I did not qualify for the forbearance because I was too many months behind and now an attorney debt collector was involved for forclosure. Now I had over {$1000.00} in attorney fees and {$480.00} in property preservation fees for the damage they did to my property. In XXXX I was told to not make a payment and to file a forbearance even though I could not qualify and as a result I had more fees added. In XXXX Phh mortgage cancelled my homeowners insurance again stating I had abandoned the home and it was vacant. This was the same time I was trying to obtain a forbearance and then was working with their attorney to try to settle the back payments. On XXXX 27 days before i had to become current I had my attorney become involved. He tried to work with phh mortgage 's attorney. We requested {$1500.00} for the damages, trespassing, and emotional suffering and another {$540.00} for the preservation fee and the property inspection fee which i had been told was from before XXXX. As part of HAMP the fee was supposed to be removed. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX a check was delivered for the full amount owed on the mortgage because both the phh and the their attorney did not return my attorney 's repeated messages. On the receipt the receptionist hand wrote {$14000.00} instead of the XXXX. Where is the missing money. It was never returned to me.

3332,2015-11-10,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account status,"I had my credit pulled for house loan application. However the credit score was quite lower than expected especially since I use credit karma to somewhat monitor my credit. I am aware that there are going to be differences, but with equifax and XXXX ( the ones XXXX uses, the gap was over XXXX points. ) XXXX had my score at equifax about XXXX, XXXX around XXXX, the credit scores that were received my home finance were XXXX and XXXX respectively. I reviewed the reason for the "" low '' score and found the reasons. 
1.derogatory public record or collection. 
I was in the hospital ( XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ). After not receiving a bill I called and asked. I was informed that bill was payed and no payment due. I was surprised and queried if info was correct. I was assured that no payments are due. About 2 months later I received from a collection agency a notice that I owe about XXXX $ to XXXX. I immediately called XXXX and was told, that there were XXXX accounts for me and that they had made an error. I told them that I have now a collection agency chasing me down for their error. I called the collection service and paid the outstanding amount. That was over 5 years ago and clerical errors have kept my score low!!! 
2.length of time credit has been etablished. 
I have been living for over 20 years in the US. I have had house payments since XX/XX/XXXX, car payments since XX/XX/XXXX, electric, gas, tv, cell phone bills for over 15 years. Credit cards and what have you. How long doe they want me to have credit.?? XXXX % of the time I pay my bills on time, that XXXX % I missed the due date which happens to the best of us. 
3.proportion of high credit on bank revolving. 
I have about XXXX $ in outstanding credit card bills, the total max/ credit limit on my cards is way over XXXX that means I owe XXXX % of maximum credit limit, how can this be a high revolving proportion of balance. 
4. Recent inquiries. 
In our days nobody has the cash to buy house or car outright. I refinanced my home, to have lower payment and pay credit cards off, and purchased a car, 11 months ago .... I ca n't see how that is a high amount of inquiries. The reporting agencies love for us to open credit cards to see that you pay them and pay on time to show you are responsibly managing your money. But then you get punished for having an inquiry on your record/ score. 
I hope you can help me out and have the situation rectified. These agencies have so much control over ones life, it 's almost criminal. I can see where people have several collections, maxed out credit cards, unpaid bills, inquiring about credit every two weeks that the score is low, but in my case it 's absolutely not the case. 
I appreciate your help!

The rep explained to me the numbers should goto the holding facility for deposits ( the credit union ) located in another town. I went to the local credit union and spoke with several member service reps and "" higher-ups '' and they were all agreed that was non-sense and they never heard of such a thing for secured accounts, that the money is sent to Elan for holding, not them. Elan called me about XXXX2 days later and told me account was past due. I told them I am trying to close the account. That the left hand was sending me to them and they were sending me to the right hand. I spoke with a supervisor, she asked me how long ago I sent the faxes.

I checked XXXX or XXXX different Elan Financial websites I could find to find the card issuer agreement which should contain the address/fax but they apparently do not publish it online.

I never receive any for closer information on my property saying they were going to foreclose on my property. Or did anyone say anything to us in the 6 to 10 calls we may in XX/XX/XXXX -XX/XX/XXXX. I talked to XXXX manger on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX before that. The representative advised me on XX/XX/XXXX to cancel my check and pay them XXXX and I would be ok, but the Manger told me to call back on XX/XX/XXXX. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and the told me I had to pay them XXXX or something close to that to get out of for closer. Ever person I talk to gives me a different amount. They will not take my payments. They always tell me it has to be a specific dollar amount. How is anyone suppose to catch up when they continue to do this to you. They harassed with phone calls one or two a day for over six months till I threatened them with my lawyer. This is when I did not miss a payment at all and when I miss a payment I get nothing to say they are going to foreclose. Then Schedule an Appointment now.

3448,2015-09-17,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account terms,"I terminated a lease XX/XX/XXXX and the judge accepted my termination letter ; the termination was on grounds that the plaintiff was trying to charge erroneous fees and had no proof that these fees were valid, the plaintiff would not allow me to pay my rent because of these fees so they then tried to file an eviction, however they were unable to evict me because I provided the judge with my request for termination along with proof that these additional fees were not valid. The judge accepted my termination request, and issued the order containing how much was to be paid through XX/XX/XXXX. 

Once I left, the plaintiff waited months before furnishing anything to creditors and when they furnished it they inflated the total by over {$4500.00} what the judge ordered with my termination request. 

After numerous written request, Experian has refused to remove the erroneous information as well as the plaintiff who reported the erroneous amounts refuses to correct the data after numerous requests in writing, they constantly contact myself and family members harassing us demanding that we pay the false amount or they will keep harassing me and because their office is technically not in Georgia they state that they do n't have to abide by the order unless I send them the order, but they were the plaintiffs so they had the order. Additionally, they have since been purchased by another company and now this company is furnishing erroneous information and refuses to remove it because when they purchased the other company "" they said that 's what I owed ''. It is a nightmare because I have a court order and judgement and they are trying to extort me because they know Experian will not remove it and it has costed me so much to try to remove this faulty information and it has prevented me from getting a new residence because it is on my credit.

XXXXFirst Niagara charges a fee to use a bank card as a debit card, but when a customer swipes their card, XXXX options appear, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Customers naturally choose the XXXX XXXX option but find that at that point in the transaction, they can not use their cards a credit, and have to use them as a debit card and pay a fee. While many customers reverse course and hit the international XXXX option so the cay pay for their groceries without having to pay the bank a fee, many customers presumably in a hurry or just frustrated and confused, decide not to bother with swiping their card again and just choose to use the card as a debit and pay the bank a fee. Customers who do cancel their transactions and start over complain about this set up and often ask me "" Why do I have hit international XXXX just to use credit, I am from the XXXX, that makes no sense ''. They say they have complained to their banks, to no avail, with the banks citing the stores card readers at fault, but they are the only bank 's whose card works like that, and customer have complained about similar experiences happening at other stores. I believe that First Niagara and XXXX intentionally set up their debit cards to work like this, so that they could confuse customers who otherwise would have not entered their pin and avoided the fee. If so they are defrauding consumers and engaging in a manipulative tactic in order to squeeze money out of people.

3554,2015-11-28,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"I was contacted by XXXX XXXX at United Consumers Incorporated ( ucicollects.com ) in XXXX 2015 about a purported debt of {$130.00} that I had with a medical provider. As I explained to XXXX, that matter was bogus as the provider had erred on a previous procedure and asked me back for a redo, explicitly stating that there would be no charge for that redo. After speaking with XXXX, within days, I finally succeeded in getting that bogus charge removed. I e-mailed the company with my account reference number at XXXXXXXXXXXX about this being resolved, and never heard back from UCI ... for a while. 

Incidentally, in XXXX 2015 I received an invoice from that provider showing that I owed nothing. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received another phone call from XXXX about this purported debt, and he indicated no awareness that we had discussed this a few months earlier. ( At that time, I was n't sure if he was the person whom I 'd spoken to in XXXX. He said nothing when I told him that I 'd spoken with someone and did n't know if it was him or not. ) He asked me if I wanted to pay it through him right then and there -- trying to receive money from me over the phone which I did not owe. He gave me the same UCI account reference number that he 'd given me in XXXX. 

While I do n't blame UCI for trying to collect money from me in XXXX for a debt that they were told I owed, it is inexcusable that they would call me months later to receive payment for a "" debt '' that even the provider had long acknowledged I did n't owe. Moreover, doing so -- telling me that I owed money which I did not -- was IN VIOLATION of 28-3814 ( f ) ( 5 ) of XXXX Code. 

Apart from the annoyance of harassment, my bigger concern has been a collections agency affecting my credit rating. 

I e-mailed XXXX and the company about this on XXXX XXXX, 2015, including a scan of the provider 's original assertion that I would not be charged for that procedure and also a scan of the XXXX invoice showing that that provider was requesting not one penny from me ( he had cited the same figure of {$130.00} that he had cited in XXXX, so it obviously was now resolved though he incompetently did n't confirm this before harassing me over the phone while I was at work ). 

On XXXX XXXX, I e-mailed the company at the XXXXXXXXXXXX address with my account reference number. I also called their phone number and left a message to alert them to all of this. I followed-up with another e-mail on XXXX XXXX, noting that I had already begun investigating legal action and became aware of that section of the XXXX code that they had unquestionably violated in harassing me by asserting that I owed money which I did not owe. 

On XXXX XXXX, I still had not heard from them with any assurance that they wold back off and that my credit rating would not be affected by any of this. 

Today is XXXX XXXX and I still have heard nothing. It has been three weeks since I last received communication from the company, when they insisted that I owed money and tried to have me pay it to them when I in fact owed nothing to that provider and had n't for months.

3555,2016-02-10,Credit card,,Balance transfer,,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am respectfully requesting some assistance with a very frustrating consumer issue. Within the last two years I had my credit card with my local credit union, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, purchased by another financial institution, ELAN Financial Services. The communication by my credit union, as well as the new institution was poor, and the transfer took place quickly with the XXXX XXXX Credit Card bill immediately changing to an ELAN Bill, XXXX that looked much like junk mail, not a credit card bill at all. As a result, I missed several payments ( up to 120 days ) to ELAN. During this period, payments were made to XXXX XXXX, but the payments were not registered or acknowledged by XXXX XXXX or by ELAN. 

The result of all of this is that I experienced several months of late payment fees, which ELAN declined to refund. In addition, and more severly, ELAN negatively affected my credit report by issuing several late payment reports. Since this time, and after I realized that this transfer was made and that I needed to send my payments to a different address/company, I have been paying this bill consistently each month. Since the incident ELAN posted a few months of on time payments, and for the last XXXX or seven months have been posting the account closed on my credit report, even though I continue to make monthly payments to this account and according to ELAN the account is active. 

For a consumer who has never had any major credit issues on my report, this is a glaring and alarming rating, which is negatively affecting my ability to obtain a credit, a mortgage or to refinance my house. I do not believe that this is fair, nor do I feel that XXXX XXXX or ELAN handled this situation well. Especially ELAN, who, even after realizing that I was not aware of the transfer, and that I had made payments to XXXX XXXX post transfer, they refused to work with me to correct their negative reporting and acknowledge my payments. It even took several MONTHS for XXXX XXXX to acknowledge the money came in and have it transferred over to ELAN. 

In the future I would never use ELAN Financial Services again, nor would I recommend them to any of my family or friends. Doing a simple google search on them, there is a long history of other consumers complaining about their practices so I know that I am not a unique case. 

Any help here that you can provide would be most appreciated. I believe that ELAN owes it to me to review and rebuke they negative reporting that they have been sending the credit reporting bureaus. 

Thank you for your cooperation and your support. 

Regards, XXXX XXXX XXXX

In good faith, we paid our {$400.00} deposit to be used towards expenses closing this loan. Our appraisal was completed and our home value returned at $ XXXX. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we were unable to move forward with the VA loan and decided to switch to a conventional loan. I was told repeatedly that this would not be an issue based on our good credit ( an excellent score of XXXX ) and income ; and even received a good faith estimate that we would need approximately $ 3k to close the loan. Suddenly, we were advised that a new appraisal would be needed and that one was returned at only $ XXXX, which meant that we would need over $ 18k out of our pocket to close the same loan. To add injury to insult, that reduction in value was after we had just spent $ XXXX in paint, new carpet, and tile work in the house, and the market value in the area has increased based on all realtor websites. I am not sure how one persons opinion ( which is what an appraisal is ) can drop the value of our home by $ XXXX. Quicken refused to use the XXXX appraisal as they said it was a VA appraisal and now we have a conventional application - how is it fair that the same Veteran lives in this house and because we ca n't get the VA loan, now our home is worth less and we are being penalized by being asked to come up with another $ XXXX in cash to close our loan? That sounds like discrimination if I have ever heard it!. This saga has dragged on for over 3 months - and now we are unable to move forward with our refinance due to the undue burden Quicken has placed on us. I have repeatedly asked Quicken to reconsider use of the original appraisal - and they refused. Not getting the VA loan just makes us less of a customer to them. I also asked then to have our {$400.00} good faith deposit returned as we did everything we were asked to do and spent day after day, hour after hour working with them ... calling them ... .having to follow up on them - what horrible customer service! Again the refused as clearly I am not a customer who can make them enough money to want to move forward. This has been the WORST customer experience we have ever had and I hope that no one else has to deal with the same level of incompetence that we have experienced with Quicken Loans!

She had names, dates, and information logged for each phone call made. PNC did not even have my correct phone number, email, nor bank info which was provided numerous times.

They have offered to reduce the monthly mortgage payment from {$2300.00} to {$2000.00} which again I am not able to afford this payment as I am the only individual currently residing in the property with reduced income by more than XXXX %. I am totally frustrated over the lack of communication and disorganization with the reps, team leaders, and supervisors on the phone.

At this time, there is a sale date set for XXXX XXXX, 2015 which I was told would be postponed until the offer letter expires on XXXX XXXX. I have no intentions nor can I financially keep this property and therefore have no other option but to pursue a short sale. My next phone call is to HUD which they advised me to contact to further investigate my file regarding pursuing a short sale. I 'm sure I am not the only account holder experiencing issues similar to this with PNC. They are once again the main reason why this file has been delayed since initiation back in XXXX as each time the info relayed is either incorrect or not relayed to where there is an understanding on both sides. Please begin the investigation asap and if need be I can provide updated financial info or whatever necessary documents required on my behalf. Thank you in advance for your time.

But even though I have been a loyal customer with an account in the black through this entire period. A representative of this company called me and informed that because I have no credit history as reported by one of these credit checking services ; meaning I have never taken out a line of credit nor do I have a mortgage type payment exc .... I also do n't have bad credit meaning I have never filed for bankruptcy or let any of those credit lines I never had go in to the red to many times. This representative used the words "" we do n't count the history you have had with our business, because we use credit checks ''. So you see my issue is not how the report was used, even though I feel that only industries that report on your credit history should be able to utilize it. My issue is that by this process being a thing it is destroying the customer to service provider relationship.

3642,2016-03-30,Credit card,,Payoff process,,"I have a Chase Credit card. I took advantage of a promotional offer to have 0 % interest for a year. That worked fine. My minimum payment went toward paying down my balance. When my promotional period ended, I took another amount w/0 % interest for a year. Now, a portion of my balance is charging interest, and a portion of my balance has 0 % interest. They add the interest based on the higher balance to that higher balance every month since my promotional period has ended. That makes sense. But, now when I am making my minimum payment, they are not crediting any of my payment toward the balance bearing the higher interest. Therefore, no part of my payment is being applied to the interest that I was charged. They are crediting the entire minimum payment to the balance w/no interest. This is causing my other balance to increase by the amount of interest charged each month, plus I am now getting charged interest on the interest that has been added each month. I have not been allowed to have any part of my payment applied toward the monthly interest charge! I thought new rules existed that prevented credit card companies from crediting your entire payment to a balance with lower interest. Apparently Chase has found some loophole where if your lower interest portion is from a promotional 0 % offer, then they only have to apply an amount over the minimum payment to the higher interest balance. If all I had was the XXXX balance that is in the promotion, my minimum payment would be less then what it is for the entire ~ {$4000.00} balance on the account at this time. I know this, because I only had XXXX minimum payment when I had ~ {$3000.00} promotional balance. I do n't understand why they would be allowed now to apply ~ {$75.00} minimum payment entirely to a promotional balance of XXXX {$1000.00}. You would think that they could only apply the minimum payment proportionately to the balances. For example, Minimum payment = {$75.00}, where {$19.00} is applied to the XXXX balance and {$56.00} is applied to the XXXX. Then, any extra amount paid over the minimum would go to the higher balance. Is it really true that they ONLY have to apply the amount OVER the minimum payment to the balance with higher interest? If this is allowed, it should n't be. Cunsumer beware of taking a subsequent promotional offer before your first one is paid for!!

The man, XXXX, gave us an application that asked if we had attended before, our income, and age. XXXX, told us to put an income of {$75000.00} so we would be eligible and that in the end it would costs us nothing. XXXX led us to their office and introduced us to XXXX and "" XXXX '' ( his middle name ). The gave us breakfast in XXXX room, then showed us a video about travel, hotels, etc an a different room. XXXX then took us to her desk and gave us some papers to fill out with our names, date of birth, and asked to see our IDs again. This man XXXX came next and said all of this was very affordable to vacation with their company. We XXXX said we did n't have jobs. I told them I volunteer for XXXX. XXXX and XXXX came and went. XXXX wrote some numbers on a paper and I was lead to believe it was affordable. He said he would run a credit check to see if an ever lower price was available. XXXX came back and said yes and offered me a free 7 day vacation stay, as well as, extra travel points at no cost. A different came out with sparkling cider, took out photo, and saying things like, "" Congratulations! '' I thought I had won something. My friend, XXXX, said he really wanted and needed a job ; I commented that I needed XXXX too, as I 'm only a volunteer and am on XXXX. They said they would hire him and took his information at this point. XXXX took us to another room with XXXX and a different young man. I told them XXXX I did n't understand completely. XXXX said it was simple and I asked how much it cost and she pointed to paper but did n't not explain it and did n't give me time to read the big pile of papers before me. She said things like you sign this because you are getting a resource guide, or initial here and it means you got the folder. 
XXXX and I mentioned many times that I did n't have a job and am a volunteer for the XXXX not a worker. They said it was so inexpensive and would put it on a credit card that I was approved for but I told them I did n't want to join if I could n't afford it or use a credit card that I knew I could not pay. I emphasized that I am XXXX, on limited income, and take medication but assured me I could pay it and enjoy an nice vacation. Upon my arrival, I spoke with my boyfriend XXXX who saw I was very upset and confused about what had occurred. XXXX also explained how XXXX misled us and how I kept saying I did n't have work or money either. XXXX looked at the papers and saw a credit card was opened in my name and charged the card over {$17000.00}. I did not authorize them to open a credit card account, only to check my credit. Now, I am fearful my credit will be affected because I ca n't afford any of this on my social security XXXX income. I feel that they took full advantage of my XXXX after telling them numerous times I was in financial hardship from dental bills. I feel my friend XXXX was taken advantage of too because he said he had just come to the XXXX within a month from the XXXX. I called the office shortly after and was told the office was closed until Friday night. They sent me with a big backpack of books and catalogs ; I told them I thought I just got a small vacation not a bunch of catalogs. They said it was so easy to call the toll-free number and the staff wished us congratulations, again and again. I also contacted the Barclay bank they opened the account in and was told I could not cancel until I received the credit card by mail. The Wyndham XXXX Company did n't take my proper full address when I noticed my apartment number missing and I do n't know if I 'll even get a card in the mail.

3818,2015-09-11,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"The loan modification I had expired in XX/XX/XXXX so my mortgage due was XXXX what I had been paying since shortly after my husband passed away XX/XX/XXXX. I could not afford the mortgage and had been negotiating with the bank for over a year. After filing a complaint here in XX/XX/XXXX, I was a contacted by a point person who said he would fast-track a modification. Five months later, I received a 3-month trial payment offer followed by a modification contract. The contract did not include debt forgiveness and stated that if I ever could not repay the loan, I would have to use other assets. As a XXXX widow, I can not afford the house my late husband left me with. I 've received notices that I 'm in severe default, followed by trustee corporation notice of foreclosure proceedings. 
On XXXX XXXX, I came home to find letters taped to my gate that said my house would be auctioned on XXXX XXXX. I have an attorney who contacted the bank on XXXX XXXX. At that time, the person he spoke with said the bank did not have a confirmed date to auction the house, and together filed an application to delay the auction. But yesterday, XXXX XXXX, my lawyer called the bank and the person he spoke with said he had no record of the application, the bank will auction my house on XXXX XXXX, and it 's too late to do anything other than foreclosure. 
I realized I can not stay here with the mortgage - way above the {$720000.00} maximum - that my late husband left me with. I just wish to have some better closure with this without having to file XXXX of documents to prove hardship. I wish to be able to have bank agree to a short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure and give me up to 2-months to clear out of the house I 've lived in for 28 years.

3822,2016-02-26,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"In XXXX XXXX I cancelled my broadband DSL internet services with XXXX when I moved from XXXX to XXXX. On the way out of town I returned the DSL modem to a XXXX kiosk at XXXX. I gave the modem directly to a XXXX employee who accepted the modem from me. The employee provided me a business card and wrote a confirmation number on the back as a receipt. I continued to receive electronic billing statements from XXXX and provided them with my new address when I cancelled service. I paid all invoices I received from XXXX. After several months I determined it was no longer necessary to retain the XXXX business card because there was no idication of a problem, so I disagreed it. In XXXX XXXX I received a collection notice from Afni , Inc dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX indicating an alleged debt with XXXX for XXXX. Discussions with Afni and XXXX personnel indicated that the alleged debt was due to an unreturned modem. Naturally, I disputed the alleged debt exercising my rights under FDCPA. I received a letter from Afni , Inc dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX indicating XXXX had provided debt validation. Attached was a "" Revised Statement '' dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The statement indicated a Previous Balance of {$0.00} and new charges of XXXX as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for the alleged unreturned modem. It appears XXXX just made up the alleged debt on the spot. It should be noted that this was the very first communication directly from XXXX indicating that the modem had allegedly not been returned, nearly 18 months after I returned the modem. Again, I called representatives from XXXX and Afni , Inc to explain the situation, and my stories fell on deaf ears. A XXXX representative told me I should return to the kiosk ( XXXX miles away ) and see if anyone ( of the high school kids working there ) remembered me returning a modem 18 months ago. An Afni , Inc representative indicated that XXXX typically does not accept modems returned at kiosks, ignoring the fact that in this case, a XXXX employee certainly did. 
The underlying unfair, deceptive, and potentially abusive practice here is that XXXX has no incentive to note document when DSL modems are received. Both XXXX and Afni , Inc indicated that since the modem was not recorded as received, that the alleged debt was owed, whether or not I actually returned the modem to XXXX. If XXXX could charge XXXX for not marking a modem received, why would they ever mark one as received? A simple XXXX search indicates this problem is not isolated to my case, and XXXX consistently claims DSL modems are not received, not holding their own receiving department accountable in any way, but consumers, like me, who in good faith returned equipment as required. It is deceptive for an employee to accept return of a modem if that is not the correct process. It is unfair and abusive to charge a consumer for "" unreturned equipment '' when it has in fact been returned. 
Further, as noted above, Afni , Inc did not provide verification of any debt upon my request under FDCPA, they simply indicated a new alleged debt was incurred on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX even though I had long since closed my account with XXXX. 
Despite claims to the contrary, I have satisfied all requirements XXXX placed on me, and should have no dealings with Afni , Inc in any was as a result. My credit is spotless, and I will not allow unfair, deceptive, and abusive tactics by these companies to stain my records.

I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX from Synchrony Bank 's representative agreeing to honor their advertisement and not charge interest to my account if it is paid in full in 24 months. Currently, I owe {$170.00} more on the {$1800.00} which I will pay in full next week. However, the bank is trying to collect some of the interest and finance charges they lost after agreeing to waive the interest if the loan is paid off in 24 months. They are doing this by alleging that I owe late charges. I have attached a copy of the loan breakdown which shows how much I am to pay each month, the date payment is due, the date payment was received and how much was paid. If you will note the minimum payment alternates from {$53.00} to {$88.00}. However, if you will note, the months I am required to pay a minimun of {$53.00}, the payment is always XXXX day late and I am charged {$35.00} late fee. The months I am required to pay a minimum of {$88.00} the payment was always received on time. I have called numerous times trying to reach XXXX XXXX XXXX to no avail. I have left messages on her voice mail but she never calls me back. I made a payment of {$100.00} the same week that I received the attached correspondence. Therefore, that payment is not on the document. It shows I have made XXXX payments of {$100.00} each instead of XXXX.

3881,2016-02-12,Consumer Loan,Installment loan,Problems when you are unable to pay,,"I have had a loan with Security Finance for over 2 years now. I have faithfully paid and renew my loan multiple times. One day I called to see if I was renewable and was told by XXXX that I was renewable for over {$200.00}. I told him i would be in on my lunch break to renew that loan. When i got there, XXXX told me once i renew my payments would go up {$20.00}. We signed the papers and i got the money. One day I was not able to make a payment on time, so i decided to ask for my principal and remaining balance. XXXX informed me that my balance was over {$1500.00} for a {$1000.00} loan, and I asked how it was that high because i had made previous payments before calling. He then decided to inform me that back in XXXX when he told me I was renewable for over {$200.00} that my loan was actually increased and not renewed. I then informed them through SEVERAL letters that I would not be paying that loan because I came in on the assumption of renewing my loan and not increasing because I could not afford a increase at the time. I feel like they were obligated to let me know that they were increasing my loan and not renewing it like they told me on the phone. By them increasing my loan without me knowing and having me come in on a renewal assumption I do not feel like I am responsible for that. They should have informed me. They call me several times and day and they call my job as well. The last person that called my job from there was XXXX and he had the nasty attitude with me and wanted to know why i had an attitude because i sure didnt have one when i came to get the money. I then informed him that I had an attitude because they failed to inform me that they were increasing my loan and had me come in on a renewal assumption. I however am still not paying them whatsoever with this loan and they have ran my credit score to XXXX. Is there anything other than not paying them that I can do about this situation?

This was more than the overdrafted amount. I still incurred XXXX fees of {$35.00}. 
I called to have these fees removed. The initial customer service rep ( XXXX ) was very pleasant but her manager ( XXXX ) was incredibly rude and condescending. I kindly requested for the overdraft fees to be removed as I had not received any notifications until it was too late. The purpose of setting up the email notifications is to inform me BEFORE fees are incurred, not after.

3921,2015-05-22,Consumer Loan,Installment loan,Taking out the loan or lease,,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I was attempting to help a friend obtain a phone through the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was advised that they had financing options that did not include pulling or reporting to my credit bureau. The gentleman in the store asked me if I wanted the payments to be withdrawn from my checking account, I advised I just needed him to make sure that my credit was not run. He said ok, finished processing the account, we received the phones, he gave me information for when the payment was due and I thought that was the end of it. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I called Fortiva as I pulled my credit report and noticed an inquiry from Fortiva and gave them a call and explained that I was told more than once that my credit report would not be run, I advised their inquiry was without permission and told them that I wanted the info to be removed from my credit report. I was told by a representative as well as a supervisor by the name of XXXX that I needed to XXXX the balance on the account and they would remove the info from my credit report. I asked for something in writing and they said they would n't be able to give me anything in writing, but to make the payment and call back and they could take care of it from there. Apparently, as XXXX informed me, there are XXXX ways for financing for XXXX phones. There is a "" Y Buy '' program that does n't include pulling a credit report and then there is "" Fortiva '' which indeed does pull a credit report. XXXX told me I could have the store cancel out the Fortiva account and instead sign me up for a "" Y Buy '' account and that would XXXX the balance or I could just pay the account down to XXXX. In not wanting anything else to do with any of their financing options I went ahead and paid off the account on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The payment updated to the account after business hours on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I called in on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and then spoke with another representative as well as another supervisor by the name of XXXX rep id # XXXX. I informed him of the previous conversation and that the account was now paid off and that I wanted them to follow through with removing the information from my credit report. He told me there was no way to do this as they do n't remove factual info from the credit report. I advised I understood not removing facts, but I did n't authorize my credit report being pulled. He said they would have to do an investigation and someone from their corporate office would call me within 3-5 business days. 14 business days later I have not received a call back or resolution to my problem so I called in on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I spoke with a representative and asked to speak to a supervisor. After almost 15 minutes on hold, the rep came back and said a supervisor was not available, he was on another call and would need to call me back. 24 hours later and I have still not received a call back. This is incredibly wrong, I have been misled and lied to and I would like some resolution to this situation.

However, as per explained today by Citibank representative, the payment was credited to XX/XX/XXXX cycle ( even though it was not included as such on the statement ) and the payment corresponding to XX/XX/XXXX is allegedly delinquent.

Upon speaking with a customer service agent of another bank, that is impossible. When a customer takes a picture of their checks, they still have the check itself in their possession. So if you take a picture of your paycheck, and upload it to us bank. It does n't show up in XXXX if you deposit it online or via mobile in XXXX. When it 's a picture taken online or via mobile app, it is still visible to you. Unlike when you go to an actual branch, it is taken from you. But mobile banking and online banking both do n't have any way to put the check in any specific branch. I did not willingly put anything anywhere. Knowing that I have told their representatives I only get ssi, and knowing that nobody gets {$15000.00} in ssi, that would be logical that my account was highjacked. The most one person may get in ssi, may be about {$2500.00} to {$3000.00}, but no more than that. As well as they stated that if you report that funds were put into your account as an unauthorized access to the account, then as long as you report it within 60 days, it should be resolved. If they think willingness, is about giving permission, it is not. If I willingly put {$15000.00} in that account, and making only XXXX a month in ssi, I doubt I willingly put anything anywhere. How can I come up with XXXX, when at most, one could only get {$1300.00} from XXXX payday loan companies? {$730.00} + {$1300.00}, equals nothing close to {$15000.00}, and the person who put it in there is XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, I do n't think that 's logical. And also, they state that in their funds availability policy, that any amount over {$5000.00}, is to have the first {$200.00} available the first business day after that was deposited, well then if that be the case, mine were available the first day they were put in. XXXX XXXX is the check issuer, but that check holder is XXXX in XXXX. And by federal law, he should be in prison for committing a purposeful fraud against wells Fargo. But wells Fargo looks at me for fault, when the last time I 've travelled outside of XXXX, is when I was a very going minor child. The check was unclear to me online. I do not know any XXXX XXXX, with XXXX XXXX in XXXX. Willingness is not permission. If what they state is true, then why was the check from an XXXX account, and XXXX address.

I was Never Late on this car, the lease was transfered thru GMAC ( {$500.00} paid by XXXX to do this ) into his ownership. I do n't know what happened at the end of the lease in XXXX, but this tradeline is being reported on My credit report, AS charge off, XXXX balance, derogatory account. Also lates are being reported on me in XXXX! XXXX, on a closed account for a vehicle I have n't owned since XXXX. 

This erroneous reporting is causing my credit scores to plummet, in turn causing my credit cards to close my accounts or slash my limits. Which then causes my scores to go even lower. This is turning into a viscous domino effect, I am pleading with banks that this is an error, however it does n't matter to them. They see derogatory language and scores dropping, and shoot first.. 

I have disputed this XXXX with XXXX, only to have GMAC respond by saying it 's valid. Scores continue to go lower. I have tried in Vain to get thru to GMAC, XXXX call centers, multiple transfers, no one ever calls you back. Request a manager same thing, the runaround, ask for an email, same thing the runaround.. Tell them that I am getting a letter a week from my creditors cutting or closing my accounts while they do nothing ... Does n't seem to have any impact. 

My XXXX XXXX XXXX scores have plummeted because of this errouneous reporting of someone else 's credit tradeline on my report. Fair credit Act violation number XXXX ... 
Thru my credit report I can see an account number and account that does NOT belong to me. violation # 2Because I am in the XXXX, I have XXXX of how the credit system works. I pulled my own XXXX credit report, thru my company to confirm this incorrect tradeline. Every year we must renew our state licenses in any state we do business in. XXXX of those states Florida also does a credit check, as we are held to minimum standards in or to stay in business, and earn a living. This renewal period is fast approaching, and If I have any trouble renewing my license this error will also be affecting my income. Fair credit reporting Act violation # 3Again I hate to go this route but have gotten NOWHERE with GMAC and Experian disputing this faulty information. This is a very simple explainable situation in the right persons hands. This GMAC tradeline in which the account number XXXX is XXXX ( the person the lease was transferred to ) account. REMOVE THIS INCORRECT DEROGATORY account from my credit report IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!! 

I am very patient and have a long fuse, but this situation is getting out of hand. I am absolutely the last person you want to screw with on this matter. I am a bank loan officer who looks at credit every day all day for borrowers, Not some schmuck uninformed retail person caught in the cogs of the machine. 

I expect to hear back on this immediately. I can provide you a professional credit report on myself showing this incorrect tradeline. ( Again someone else 's derogatory Personal information ) on my credit report. I have not owned this vehicle since XXXX, yet XXXX is strangely reporting me late last month, on this closed ( since XXXX ) account ... ... Total non-sense.. 
I want this deleted Immediately, Electronically,, asap before any more harm is done to my credit or credit lines ... I will be more than happy to discuss this matter with anyone of authority from any of these places. GMAC is 100 % in the wrong here, not only on their sloopy reporting, but their lack or corrective measures once they were made aware of this inaccuracy. My cell XXXX am having financial issues with all my banks and credit cards, due to faulty reporting.This is a huge pain in the XXXX, and every resasonable attempt I have made to resolve this goes NOWHERE.

I make monthly deposits into the account and regularly make withdrawals into my XXXX bank account ( linked to the savings account ). On XXXX I scheduled a withdrawal from CO360 to the XXXX account to drop into XXXX on XXXX. This morning, I logged into XXXX and it was n't there. I then logged into CO360 and it was n't there either ( see attachment ). I called XXXX and they said it was n't in the XXXX for today at all. They had no evidence that it was anywhere. I then called CO360 and said where 's my money? because it had been taken out of my CO360 account altogether. They claimed it would take 2 business days to get to XXXX. I said I get that when I make an unscheduled withdrawal but that is not right for a scheduled withdrawal. And never since I 've owned the account, whether making a scheduled or unscheduled withdrawal, has the withdrawal shown as gone from my CO360 account and not deposited on the same day to my XXXX account. So, in order to get the deposit to XXXX as scheduled, I was required to wire the money at my own cost of {$30.00} or wait until Tuesday to get the money to XXXX. So, I was no longer the "" owner '' of the funds in either location. My {$2000.00} was in someone else 's possession altogether, being used by someone else to get the "" float '' and I was no longer getting anything, interest or use. In fact, for all I know, it was in the pocket of some hacker in XXXX. This ca n't possibly be legal. I get that they can, as an account term, take 2 business days. But never for those 2 business days has the money not still been shown as being owned by me in my 360 account. This was the first time ever they pulled this stunt. I will be demanding the refund of the {$30.00} shakedown and closing the account now, but I hope you will investigate this.

4012,2015-05-18,Debt collection,Credit card,Communication tactics,Threatened to take legal action,"I had been paying on a credit card that I had for my business, although the card is in my personal name. After I closed the business, I came to an agreement with a collection company to continue making payments. I lost my job at the end of XX/XX/XXXX but continued making small payments to the company. I was making these payments with money from Unemployment Compensation, which I received for 6 months. I was not having success in finding work so decided to go back to school to change careers. 
I received a notice from the collection agency/attorney that they would be filing a lawsuit if I did n't settle on the account. I contactedthem and spoke to XXXX XXXX ( with whom I had been working for quite a while when I was making payments ). I wanted to come up with some kind of deferment or plan that was workable now that I am no longer working. Because I felt an impending threat, I offered to make a {$1000.00} payment after speaking to friends to come up with the money. XXXX XXXX said that they could take the money then and have a monthly amount that would increase over time. I did not want to make that commitment over the phone and asked him to send me a copy of the agreement. He agreed to this. In the conversation, it was implied that the legal action would not proceed while I was waiting for a copy of the suggested payment plan. They took my money, which I presumed was a sign of good faith from me. 
The only money that I am receiving now is from student loans that I have taken out to go to graduate school. Any money in my bank account has come from these loans. 
I assume that XXXX XXXX XXXX has since written off the account balance. There have been many collection agencies I have made payments to for this account and it seems that each company has gotten more and more aggressive with their collection tactics. 
This is n't the only debt that I have remaining from the closure of my business. I have made small payments to various collection companies for several debts. When I was working, I was able to settle on some of them, or pay them off completely. 
I am now in a situation where I will not be able to earn income until I graduate in XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. The program I am enrolled in is very rigorous and does n't allow me time to work. I am XXXX years old so I do n't have the energy that my fellow students have, and it takes all of my time to complete my schoolwork. 
I feel that this company has been very aggressive with me. I have made payments when I can and they have kept applying pressure. After I received their latest communication ( packed into a very small envelope. I opened it with the expectation that it was finally the contract that I had requested ), I was not able to sleep well for XXXX nights. 
It has never been my intention to file bankruptcy. I have worked very hard to avoid it but feel that companies like this, and their pressuring tactics, are driving me to this. I feel harassed and taken advantage of.

In summary, our loan was originally with Countrywide, and it was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. After 18 months and XXXX applications for a loan modification to Bank of America ( hereinafter BofA ), and numerous lies to us from BofA, our loan 's servicer, including asking repeatedly for the same documents over and over, we were denied a loan modification, for which we were qualified to receive. BofA blamed XXXX, and XXXX said they would n't do modifications because they did n't take any TARP money. We were getting different stories from both institutions, with each institution blaming the other for why we could n't receive a modification. Our loan was sold XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which did take TARP money and which does loan modifications. So, we applied again to BofA, our loan 's servicer for XXXX XXXX XXXX, for a loan modification in XXXX XXXX because we are three months late due to a temporary illness, which has been resolved. We have submitted every document requested, including a hardship letter, and answered every question, speaking with BofA representatives on almost a weekly basis. We spoke to a representative just last week again, who confirmed that they had all of the documents and information necessary from us, and that our loan modification application was in Underwriting for review. We also had received a letter confirming our application was under review back in XX/XX/XXXX. Today, XXXX XXXX, we received a letter stating that our application for a loan modification was no longer under review because the required documents had not been submitted. We called BofA today and confirmed with their representative, XXXX XXXX, that they did in fact have all of the documents, including a Schedule D from our taxes which they had requested, which we had already sent, which had been confirmed as received, and which she could see in their system, but that the file had been closed. Our file had been closed in error. We are desperately trying to avoid foreclosure. So, she said we had to re-submit our Request for Mortgage Assistance again with today 's date, along with more pay stubs from my wife, which XXXX added to what we had already sent. This is exactly what we went through before, and we are desperate to save our home. So, we have re-submitted our Request for Mortgage Assistance requesting a loan modification yet again, dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, with additional pay stubs, which XXXX requested today during our phone conversation about our file closed in error. We need help in getting BofA to truly look at our application and give us a loan modification and not give us the run around like they did before, and like they are giving us now. That is why BofA had a huge settlement against them by the Department of Justice, but they are behaving the same way as before the settlement and are not working to help people save their homes. We need help to save our home and have not walked away from our home, like so many others. Please help us, American Citizens, save our home by making sure BofA gives us a fair chance to save our home by giving us a loan modification. We currently have an interest-only 6.5 % home loan and are just asking for a normal P & I loan with a lower interest rate ( given the much lower rates today ), so that we have a chance and do not become like many of those Americans who lost their homes, when the banks failed to work with them on loan modifications. Our loan account manager is XXXX XXXX at XXXX.

4047,2016-02-06,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I am filing this complaint because I was denied a loan modification for my rental property in XX/XX/XXXX. The property was my primary residence from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX when I remarried. Although my ex-husband and I originally purchased the house for {$120000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, I refinanced the house in XX/XX/XXXX at the time of my divorce to buy my ex-husband out of the house, in the amount of {$210000.00} at a rate of 6.5 %. My monthly mortgage payment increased from under {$1000.00} to between {$1700.00} and {$1800.00} ( depending on the most recent escrow analysis ). In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Wells Fargo in order to apply for a loan modification due to financial hardship. ( After my daughter was born in XX/XX/XXXX, my job position was eliminated during my maternity leave. My husband and I made the decision that I would stay home, care for our daughter and help my husband with his business. My husband, although he derives some income from XXXX, is chronically ill and receives social security XXXX income. ) My income includes rental income from the property as well as child support payments. However, despite proving financial hardship, as well as never having missed a payment, I was denied the loan mod because it is a rental property. Although I was only told this verbally, a follow-up letter from W.F. revealed that I was not able to prove sufficient income for the loan modification ( despite never having missed a payment ) with no mention of it being a rental property. The rental property law changed in XX/XX/XXXX which Wells Fargo seems to be unaware of. A year later in XX/XX/XXXX, a local W.F. representative contacted me about the possibility of doing a loan mod or a HARP refinance. I explained that I had already been denied a loan modification, but he affirmed that he would help me refinance through the HARP program. Again, I submitted all documentation and waited, and again I was denied for the same reason. This representative was no longer reachable by phone or email. 
I am a mother of XXXX, ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX in XXXX school and a XXXX-year-old ) and am a full-time accelerated XXXX. I will be graduating in XX/XX/XXXX as an XXXX. and have made a decision to do this in order to provide a better life for my family as my husband 's health declines. I also help him run his home office. 
The property is currently occupied by a single mother of XXXX who is on XXXX. Although she is a good tenant, her son recently got into some trouble and caused a break-in to the property and an ensuing police raid. There was considerable damage done to the property which I had to pay for because my insurance company only paid a small amount for XXXX item, and the police would not pay for their damage in the raid. The tenant does not have the funds to pay, although she would like to. Additionally, the child support enforcement office prematurely stopped my child support payments in XX/XX/XXXX which has resulted in me not receiving any payments since XX/XX/XXXX. ( We are working to reestablish those payments but it will be a process. ) None of this would be an issue if my mortgage had been reduced by several hundred dollars per month in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I am now nearly 2 months behind in my mortgage payment and have received a letter of acceleration from Wells Fargo. 
I feel that it is ridiculous that I am still paying 6.5 % on a mortgage that I 've had for 10 years where customers with regular jobs ( and no hardships ) are able to reduce their payments to 3 %. Is the point of a loan mod to help people like me? Wells Fargo is preying on people like me who do n't have much of a voice, waiting for the loan to go into default so that they can claim the property. They have questioned why I want to keep the property, to which I answer, it is my house. I have worked hard to keep it all these years and I hope to pass it to my children or my parents when they are in need

4055,2015-08-14,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"XXXX XXXX, a loan Consultant from NationStar started a loan application to do an FHA streamline refinance, she gave me a rate and pressured me to lock it. I refused because I wanted to shop for a better one. After a few days, I called her back to continue with the application, she refused and promised to call back. She never call back. Nationstar sent a letter to my house claiming I requested a payoff of {$320000.00} dollars and must be paid in full of the end of this month. I never made such request. I believed this was done because I was shopping around for a better deal. I attempted to refinance again in order to determine if this was a pattern with Nationstar, and spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. he informed he was not able to pull my credit because I have a freeze on my Credit Score. I knew this was a lie because I lifted the Freeze for 30 days. When a loan application was originated by XXXX XXXX, I noticed a XXXX XXXX, 2015 date on the application before the agreement will become null and void. I call him and he explained that he must used the previous date that XXXX XXXX had started because I had locked the rate. This was a lie. He told me instead of 60 days, I will have 45 days to complete the application. I review the application and forward it to XXXX XXXX. I sent over all required documentation except for the Home Insurance Declaration Page. When I contacted my insurance company XXXX, which is affiliated with XXXX, they informed me that my insurance was cancelled due to the fact they did not received payment. I was perplexed because I have an escrow account with Nationstar. In addition, my wife contacted Nationstar XX/XX/XXXX before the insurance was cancelled and spoke to a representative name XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted the necessary information. After reaching out to them to find out what was happening, Nationstar lied and informed me they attempted to reach out to XXXX and sent me letters to inform me they were not able to reach XXXX. I spoke to several representatives XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and a manager by the name of XXXX on different dates XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ] trying to understand why they failed to pay my home insurance. I attempted to buy different home insurance, but was told because of the lapsed with XXXX, they could not offered me one. The only one I received was with XXXX, XXXX, which required payment from me and not through an escrow. I refused because it was Nationstar who made the mistake. Because of Nationstar, I 'm not able to refinance with them or any other company before I have home insurance. They have ruined my name because I can not get home insurance. To matter worse, they sent me a letter on XXXX XXXX, 2015 threatening to place a high premium insurance on the house and lied and stated that I had informed them that I was going to pay Home Insurance directly. To avoid the high premium, I decided to go with XXXX and paid out my pocket {$1200.00}, which is more than I paid before of {$850.00} with XXXX. This a bullying tactic by a major company who is trying to cover its mistake. I did everything right, paid my mortgage, informed them of the Home Owners Insurance company, but yet I 'm the victim of unfair business practice by Nationstar.

As part of the short sale Citi released the lien and we agreed to continue paying as scheduled. We have done so since that time and are in good standing. The servicer is now XXXX XXXX. We 're attempting to purchase a home and through the validation process XXXX XXXX has notified the company we 're attempting to obtain a loan through that this loan is still secured by the original address. They state they have no record of it not being tied to that property and are blaming it on Citi Financial 's record keeping. I informed the agent I was submitting a formal complaint on the CFPB site and he got upset and started to try and argue with me as to why they were n't responsible. He said they could only go off the info Citi provided them with and that they are n't responsible if the information is inaccurate. That 's when I asked to speak to a manager who told me it would they were unable to research at that time and stated it was my responsibility to provide them with the evidence of the short sale. She then suggested we call Citi to obtain the needed info. 
We then called Citi. And Citi is stating when they sold the account to XXXX XXXX XXXX years ago ( XXXX years after the short sale ) it was tied to property and provided me with the address I was renting at as the collateral. When I stated that I was renting at that address they transferred us to their Short Sale department. The first agent we spoke with in the Short Sale department said that they were n't the servicer of the loan and attempted to hang up. Without listening to my response she went directly into her call closing. We had to yell and say "" wait, wait, wait, do n't hang up please! '' to prevent her from disconnecting the call. We ended up speaking spoke to supervisor XXXX in what we later learned was the Mortgage Dept. She tried to transfer us to the personal loan department which was closed at XXXX CST on Thursday XXXX.

When I notified the agents at Citi I wanted them to document this as a formal complaint they ignored me and did n't seem to care that I when I told them I 'd be escalating this to the CFPB if not resolved. 
I 'm back at square one with no resolution and seemingly nowhere to turn. I 'm very upset that this may impact my ability to obtain a loan for a home for my family. We have relocated expecting to be able to purchase a place to live, and this seems to be the only thing that may hold that up.

The representative informed me that our loan modification had been denied in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and that this letter is sent to bring loan current or foreclosure proceedings would be filed. I explained to the B of A representative that i had spoken to account manager in XX/XX/XXXX regarding loan modification and was told the status was still being reviewed/ no decision! B of A representative could not explain why we were told it was still in process when it had been denied. Per the B of A representative one of the reasons we were denied for loan modification is that loan was not delinquent, but the fact is it was, which letter of Intent certainly confirms. There was one other reason which had to do with our income being too high ... and that was just shocking because my husband and I can both testify to the fact that we live month to month on our income, very, very, VERY modestly. The B of A representative recommended I contact XXXX XXXX ( not sure of spelling ) XXXX. XXXX is the supervisor of the Account Manager 's. I had complained that none of the Account Manager 's I had spoken to, assigned to our loan modification, could answer any of my questions regarding income, declination, etc. So on the advise of B of A representative I left an urgent voice mail for XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/16 and p another 2 urgent voice mail messages on XXXX/XXXX/16. I never received a return call, not to either of our contact phone numbers. My voice mail messages were very specific, matter was urgent, regarding loan modification declination, reasons for decline, and needed explanation. I gave all our loan information, number, etc. 
There was no message on XXXX 's voice mail saying he was out of office, that he would not be returning calls, etc. I think that it is outrageous that someone in his position would ignore urgent calls for 2 days. In fact I think that should be illegal in banking. 
I feel that the only way I get some one to return my calls is to file formal complaints ... and that is a very bad reflection on B of A and staff. 

All of this can be verified by phone calls since every phone call that I have made has been recorded per a representative and then there are the voice mail messages left on XXXX 's extension.

He turned the pages quickly, as he commented on what a certain page was telling me, and I signed it. He also said, "" Just because you are paying {$41.00} every 2 weeks does not mean it will be paid off at the end of the 90 days. '' I laughed and said, well I would n't think it would be.

It was then that I told the representative from Merchant 's Preferred that the salesman never said anything to me about interest being charged during the 90 days.

I did XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2014. I was told the process would take no more than 30 days, this was untrue. It was not until XXXX XXXX, 2014 that an appraisal was finally completed of my home. My home valued at {$450000.00} well above the previous appraisal, qualifying me for removal of the PMI insurance from my loan. Before honoring my request XXXX XXXX conveniently sold my loan to Residential Credit Solutions. I of course immediately called XXXX financial providers and XXXX assured me that my request to remove my PMI insurance would be honored. I called Residential Credit Solutions on XXXX XXXX they confirmed receipt of my appraisal from XXXX XXXX valuing my home at {$450000.00}, but I was told it was under review. I subsequently also received my copy of the appraisal on XXXX XXXX, 2014. I continued to call Residential Credit Solutions several times speaking with different agents ( XXXX, XXXX, several gentlemen ) and in XXXX I was told nothing could be done until my loan reached the 2 year mark which would be as of XXXX XXXX. I called Residential Credit Solutions XXXX week of XXXX and spoke with XXXX ID # XXXX she was supposedly a supervisor she told me I was eligible for PMI cancellation she confirmed she saw my current appraisal on file and said she would process the cancellation. She asked me to call back in a week or so. I called back and spoke with XXXX he also advised he could see in their system my request for PMI cancellation was being processed he also confirmed receipt of my current appraisal from XXXX of 2014. He said he would call me back to confirm results of review within an hour. He never called back. I called back XXXX again spoke with XXXX she then advised me they had no receipt of my current appraisal she instructed me to fax in my copy of the XXXX 2014 appraisal to their correspondence department. I faxed over my appraisal that same day. I called back today XXXX/XXXX/15 spoke with XXXX he advised they have receive my appraisal but my request has been denied. I would have to file a whole new request with them and pay a new {$500.00} appraisal fee. I asked to speak with a manager I spoke with XXXX she advised the same they will not honor the appraisal from XXXX XXXX I would have to pay again and make a new request. 

I am beyond frustrated, I followed all the requirements from XXXX XXXX I paid for a new appraisal. I have no control over the fact that XXXX XXXX sold my loan to Residenital Credit Solutions and I have been jerked around and XXXX by both XXXX XXXX and now by Residential Credit Solutions they know I am entitled to PMI cancelation and they are just trying to rip me off with demanding {$500.00} more dollars for an unnecessary new appraisal. 

Please help me I am at my wits end!!!

Today XXXX I received a letter from US Bank stating that my XXXX payment has not been received yet, although funds were deducted from my account on XXXX/XXXX/15. I called the construction loan department and after 1 hour on hold to speak to a rep they confirmed my XXXX payment was not in.

She explained the funds I paid on XXXX were received but the system did not apply the amount to the actual XXXX pmt ; she explained they are having issues with their system and the funds were sitting on a "" suspense account '' not applied to the XXXX pmt. She also explained the rep who processed the XXXX payment charged me the late fee in the amount of {$68.00} and {$11.00} payment processing fee even when he said he was not going to because those fees were waived. I explained my concerned regarding a 30 day late payment to be reported to the bureaus due to an issue with their system. XXXX XXXX explained that if the late payment was reported in error they were going to have it removed although I am not happy with that because i will have to call the bank, being 3 hrs on hold to get this resolved, get my XXXX credit report, dispute and wait another 4-5 months for a resolution. XXXX XXXX stated she was going to request a credit to be applied to my account to cover that late fee and payment processing fee i should not have paid and that my amount due for XXXX should be {$2100.00} - {$68.00} ( late fee ) - {$11.00} payment processing fee, which is a total of $ XXXX this will be the amount I will be paying for XXXX and I hope not getting any default letters etc from the bank. Regarding the XXXX payment I made the payment before the XXXX thru their bill pay system over the phone and the payment went thru 1.5 months after I made the payment. It appears that US Bank has major problems with their system and should spend some funds in technology. 
XXXX XXXX also explained they deducted from my escrow account {$1900.00} to pay the first half of the 2015 taxes and now I am being responsible to pay an escrow shortage. My close of escrow was XXXX XXXX 2015 and I am not responsible to pay for the taxes due for the XXXX half only a small portion of it from XXXX/XXXX/2015 to XXXX/XXXX/2015 the lender should claim that amount they paid from XXXX/XXXX/2015 to XXXX/XXXX/2015 to the Title company and do not have the consumer pay for something I am not responsible for. Per the county my property was classified as a vacation home on the affidavit of value by the lender and the title company and as a result my taxes are higher. My property is a primary home and should not be classified as a vacation home

Everything was fine and I had automatic withdrawals from the bank account I had at the time. Once my home was in escrow, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and made my final payment. They told me nothing else was needed to close the account and I was in good standing. I did not purchase any equipment from them, nor did I live in the home. A few months later I got a bill in the mail. I called to inquire about it and again they told me it was resolved. Several months passed and I received another bill for an outrageous amount. I called again and they told me that I did not cancel my contract and that I have to pay for a service whether I lived in the home or not. I offered to pay a portion of it out of good faith if they sent me a final bill with a cancelation policy and the account manager "" XXXX XXXX '' told me no. In his words "" black mail my credit '' if I did n't pay 36 months of payments ( I only signed up for 21 months ). I refused and called again to speak to someone above him which I was denied my request. After I requested to be contacted via email so I can have a document of everything he was staying. I asked for a contract stating where I signed up for all of this and they provided a contract. The amount of months my contract was for was crossed out in pen and re-written and they added to months to it, with no initial or signature indicating that I was in agreement with them. In fact I never gave them my social sec #. Also I found it strange that when they sent me a copy, under my signature shows a cut off signature of whoever "" Accepted/signed '' the contract and it has a complete different date on it. SO pretty much you sign a contract, then they modify and resign at another date and tell you that you owe them money. I was upset and I told them I am sorry I can not pay money for something I did not ask for. Two years later I look at my credit report and there it is. This is unfair and unjust. I have went on social media to post a negative review to warn other potential victims, also gave them a review on yelp. The more research I have done I noticed that there are many more people who are in the same situation and worse.

When I contacted SLS on XXXX/XXXX/15 for a status update and resolution before I made another payment to sit in a suspense account, SLS transferred me to over XXXX agents and said they could not find any documentation and my final loan modification had been denied and threatened foreclosure. I have been working with SLS during hardships for over three years to resolve the defaulted mortgage payments. SLS denied XXXX distinct offers to purchase the listed home from different buyers in two years via the short sale XXXX process. Then we pursued Deed in Lieu and Loan Modifications, I completed the Trial modification and due to SLS mismanagement, fraudul ; XXXX practices, unethical standards, and poor customer service my final modification is not being processed and causing me extreme stress and continued financial hardship. 
I would like this situation to be investigated and resolved immediately, my final loan modification reinstated, and my suspense payments applied to the new modification.

XXXX, OH XXXX XXXX : Letter of Intent to File Suit To Whom It May Concern : This letter serves as the formal notice of my intent to file a lawsuit against FABCO dba Federal Adjustment Bureau for {$25000.00} as a result of violations of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( XXXX ; commonly referred to as XXXX ) and Unfair, Deceptive & Abusive Practices ( UDAPP ). I contacted your company which listed a fraudulent account on my credit on several occasions. At which time I requested you remove the fraudulent listing and have even sent verification from the Criminal Investigations Division of the XXXX XXXX XXXX Police showing the account is a result of identity theft. During my final attempt I requested very specific documentation to show this account is valid knowing full and well such documentation can not be provided as it is a result of ID Theft. To which you responded with a packet of paperwork which did not include the information requested. Thus rendering the debt invalid under FDCPA. Your company not only continued to report the invalid debt on my credit but also sent me notices demanding payment on said fraudulent account. 
There was no evidence to support your claim that I owe or agreed to this debt outside of what appears to be a line written contract which I did not sign. The "" Signature '' bears no resemblance to my own and you failed to furnish anything of mine ie. a drivers license or social security card. Considering I work for a law firm I have never seen a lease agreement that the rental agent did not obtain of copy of such documents. 
Your company was also provided a "" Release Of Claims '' understand that release does not have any bearing on this case considering it sites specific laws your company was release from liability on. Now given my previous experience your company will draw out the process for as long as possible but due to the negligence and disrespect exhibited by your company which I have no problem with. I also previously advised I would be working with a lawfirm. At this time I have opted against doing so and will be handling the case myself. 
If you choose to just pay the {$7500.00} and avoid further cost to your company that would be agreeable. If not then this letter will serve as your 14 day Initail Demand prior to suit being filed. 

Your prompt attention is appreciated, XXXX XXXX

This closed account is from a former automotive loan. The vehicle was repossessed in XXXX XXXX and went into charge-off status in XXXX XXXX. Further, the account will be 7 years of age since date of first deliquency in XXXX XXXX, and should be removed from my credit bureau reports already, if not soon. Over the last XXXX years, I have spoken with several individuals at XXXX ( last month to a supervisor there ), and each time they agree that it is reporting incorrectly, and each have stated they would get it corrected. The supervisor, XXXX XXXX, has not responded to my voice mails for weeks now. 

Details : Equifax : I previously disputed this more than 2 years ago, and XXXX did not respond to my dispute, so it was deleted. Then, as of XX/XX/XXXX, it was reinserted, but instead of being closed with negative information it is now reporting "" XXXX '' and "" Pays account as agreed '' and shows no former negative account activity. Neither Equifax nor the creditor notified me of this reinsertion per the FCRA law ( which states they have 5 days to do such ). As of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I 've disputed this with Equifax based on that law, and Equifax has opened another investigation. I 've attached XX/XX/XXXX reports direct from Equifax and also from XXXX showing that this account was not listed under my Equifax data, as well as a XX/XX/XXXX report from XXXX showing it has been reinserted under Equifax. 

XXXX : I 've attached a XXXX XXXX report from XXXX showing the account is "" Open '', was late in XXXX XXXX, a repo in XXXX XXXX, and a CO ( charge-off ) in XXXX XXXX. You 'll see on the same report that XXXX changed the dates on the CO to XXXX XXXX, then to XXXX XXXX, yet reporting "" OK '' many times over the years. This XXXX XXXX report shows "" By XXXX XXXX, this account is scheduled to go to a positive status ''. I 've also attached a XXXX XXXX report showing the payment history as completely different than the XXXX XXXX report. It shows COs of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, which do not match the same COs from the XXXX XXXX report, nor does it show the CO from XXXX XXXX, nor any of the XXXX account data as just discussed from the XXXX XXXX report. Each time an "" OK '' or "" CO '' is reported it changes the active status of the account and moves the date of positive status or deletion in the credit file to an additional plus approx. 7 years. This XXXX XXXX report shows "" This account is scheduled to continue on record until XXXX XXXX. "", also different. 

XXXX : On my XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX report, you 'll see this account is listed in my XXXX data. However, you 'll see in my XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX report showing this account was deleted ( see the bottom of page XXXX of the report ). You 'll also see that it has not showed back up in my XXXX XXXX report. I 've also attached a XXXX XXXX report showing the same XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX proper account history data, which compares correctly to the XXXX XXXX XXXX report. 

Summary : - XXXX : The data should only show that this account is closed and a charge-off, that it went 30 days late in XXXX XXXX, an "" R '' ( repossession ) in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, and then a CO ( Charge-Off ) in XXXX XXXX. It will be 7 years from date of first deliquency as of next month, and should be fully removed no later than then, if not already, just like it has already been removed from my XXXX data. 

- Equifax : Per the FCRA law, this account was reinserted into my Equifax data without proper notification to me, and should be promptly removed.

Because I was late on an HOA fee of {$25.00} a debt collector auctioned my property for {$20000.00} to some straw buyer the collectors office attorney created just to steal my property. This all happened on XXXX XXXX, 2014. 
Seterus has played ignorant when in fact they knew what this Collection agent did to me instead of helping, they send their attorney ( XXXX, XXXX & XXXX ) into the court house to start foreclosing on me. I have been foghting for the rights to my title to be returned to me for 2 years. 
Now that XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX attorneys want to leave the case and decided to name one of their buddies as a substitute attorney for their fraudulent conveyances and fraudulent acts they have committed against the title to my property. 
SETERUS, is the worst servicer, they claim that I am in default however they never tell you your rights under the Federal Fair Debt practice act, they are unprofessional and without knowledge as to even who the lender on the deed of trust is. 
When I ask them who the lender is they state that the lender is XXXX, which is incorrect. I have also asked them who this new attorney was, that claims to be the attorney for Seterus, he goes by the name of XXXX XXXX, of XXXX attorney at law.Sererus claims they never hired this attorney to represent them. They do n't seem to know who this person is. 
My great concern is that this XXXX XXXX, is the one answering all this complaints in this portal and yet will not provide a copy of the retainer agreement. I have also asked for the copy of the note for my loan and to this date nothing has been mailed. I want XXXX XXXX, to no longer respond to my requests here until a retainer agreement is mailed to me for proof of representation. 
I have also noticed that SETERUS, made themselves the beneficiary of my deed of trust however no one allowed them or nominated them. After they made themselves the beneficiary they then gave that right to XXXX without any right or authority. 
Seterus, is in complete denial of what they themselves allowed to happened to the title to my property, I informed them what was happening when the collector was threatening foreclosure over a debt they inflated from {$50.00} to XXXX on purpose. Seterus lied and told me that a debt collector can not take the property and now that they removed my name, Seterus is being compensated by XXXX, while they have treated me very poorly. They have purposely sent their crew of attorneys to take my home and claim I have missed 2 years of payments, I will not pay a home where my name has been purposely removed from title by monsters, corrupt even attorneys. SETERUS, knows what is going on and yet continues to ask I have not been paying my loan. They are placing erroneous charges onto my statements and someone in that SETERUS, is manipulating my mortgage statements and pocketing money. Their is a XXXX XXXX, that works their possibly a relative of XXXX XXXX, perhaps committing some type of fraud. 
I am extremely upset with this SETERUS, they are not conducting themselves as a debt collector and should be shut down, the call center is a joke, no one there has an idea how loans work or even how to answer your questions. I believe this SETERUS, has been taken over by some corrupt attorneys engaged in some serious fraud.My call appears to be routed to a call center that is not connected to any real loan servicer.

In XXXX XXXX, I purchased a home with my mother ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) as a cosigner. The mortgage company is CitiMortgage ( loan # XXXX ). Doing well the first few years, I struggled in XX/XX/XXXX and then again in XX/XX/XXXX, due to losing my job and health issues. I thought CitiMortgage Loss Mitigation department was helping me, unfortunately the "" re finance '' was more than what I owed on my home, more than what it was worth, and higher monthly payments. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I had XXXX and was out of work for a while plus IRS placed a tax levy on my payroll. I was having a hard time again with my mortgage payments. I decided to do a short sale, so I would not have a foreclosure. I spoke with a man by the name of XXXX XXXX with CitiMortgage and he told me "" once I had a buyer that CitiMortgage would then work with my realtor ''. 

I then had XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX / short sale specialist ) out to my home and listed my house a short sale. After several offers we had one in XXXX XXXX that was reasonable of XXXX, with earnest money of XXXX down. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, had the contract with all information needed sent to CitiMortgage. 
It has been a nightmare. After eight months of sending CitiMortgage ( through XXXX XXXX ) all of our bank statements, payroll stubs, hardship letters, my mother 's retirement statements, her bank statements, our XXXX 's and tax records for the last several years. They continue to keep us hanging and waiting for the next step. Every time CitiMortgage wanted more information we would send it. 
Now, CitiMortgage sends us a memo : Good Afternoon XXXX, I trust both you and XXXX are well. This is your regular weekly status update email, in which I regret to report we have crossed the hard stop deadline on liquidation assistance prior to foreclosure ( thanks to the sale date that appeared since your last update, placing the deadline back on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). The only options at this stage are to reinstate or payoff the loan ( including legal costs/fees, quotes for which may be obtained directly from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX ), or declare other legal debt protection measures. Should I see anything of note this coming week I will contact you as soon as feasibly possible, otherwise you may look forward to your weekly status updates up until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Please do not hesitate to jot yourself a note for our regular weekly contact or reply to this email if you have any questions in the interim, and since it 's a new month I would appreciate a quick "" thank you '' to acknowledge receipt of this message. 
Remember, during any point of your treatment review you can reach me at ( XXXX ) XXXX, Ext. XXXX, Monday - Friday XXXX XXXX. - XXXX XXXX. ( CT ), or email me XXXXXXXXXXXX. I look forward to working with you.

4562,2015-03-27,Debt collection,I do not know,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"I first received a phone call from "" XXXX '' at Atlantic Credit and Finance , Inc. '' at my business, which I own, where the gentleman asked for me by first name only. The XXXX phone call attempt from AC & F I was not available to come to the phone, XXXX told my employee that he would wait on the phone until I became available, when my employee refused his offer he said there was no message. XXXX called back a few hours later, at this time I answered the phone. Our conversation began with XXXX telling me that I owed money for a past debt in the amount of over {$3000.00} from the company "" XXXX ''. I responded quickly telling him I have never owned or been billed for a "" XXXX '' credit card and therefore he had to have had the wrong person. That is when he began asking me personal financial information about myself just to "" check '' if he had the right person. He asked me what my address was, what my social security number was, banking information, etc. I refused to answer these questions and told him that if he is trying to collect a past debt from me HE SHOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION in front of him. He assured me that he did indeed have all of my personal information in front of him and that he was just asking so that he could verify this information. I than asked him to please read to me the, address, social security number, and name of the banking institution he had on file for me, he only gave a false S.S. number before I stopped him and told him once again that HE HAD THE WRONG PERSON. After about a half hour of XXXX trying to "" trick '' information out of me I finally got him to agree that he had the wrong person, he apologized for the inconvenience and we hung up the phone. The next day my company received another phone call from XXXX again. He began the conversation this time the exact way he began it the day before as if we had'nt even spoken with each other before. When I reminded him that he had called me yesterday and I thought that we have resolved the issue, he just ignored me and kept going on with his interrogation for my personal information. This time I told him to please verify where I applied for this "" XXXX '' card, where I made the so called purchases, what address and name was "" XXXX '' sending statements to, in regards to this account. He tried avoiding the questions and it seemed to me that he would pause, as if he was being fed information to repeat back to me. I told him to send me as much information as he had on this account so that I could look into it myself. He told me he could not send any of the information. I told XXXX that I needed to look into this issue more and asked him for his phone number so that I could call him back once I found out more about this issue. 
Once I got off the phone with Atlantic Credit and Finance , Inc. I researched the company online and was able to find out that I was not the first person that has an experience like this with them. I called my Attoroney General 's Office and told them a little bit about the phone call. I gave the Attoroney General 's Office Atlantic Credit and Finance 's company name, address, and phone number and they told me that the company has be dissolved for over four years.

At this time we also learned that the school was not bonded as required, and that the State had been investigating the company for some time now. They had little to no assets. 
The next several years were spent working on my XXXX XXXX through XXXX University and working as much as possible to support my wife and I and to pay off my debts, all while trying to figure out how to complete my education to qualify me for a job as a pilot. XX/XX/XXXX I learned of the XXXX program through the XXXX and began the application process right away. XX/XX/XXXX, I was selected, and just days after my XXXX son was born, I joined the United States XXXX. In XXXX I left for XXXX, and upon completion of XXXX I was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX to attend XXXX. After becoming a XXXX, I successfully completed XXXX and started XXXX, which I completed and graduated from just last month as a XXXX XXXX. 
The time since XXXX XXXX XXXX 's closure has been especially trying both financially and emotionally for my wife and I. It has placed a significant financial hardship on our family as we 've struggled to meet our needs, provide for our XXXX children, and have had to place all other financial goals on hold due to the substantial amount of student loans we are paying monthly. We pride ourselves on our desire to be financially responsible and to maintain a good financial standing and feel we have managed these loans to the best of our ability, however it is becoming increasingly more difficult to manage. We feel especially blessed and grateful to have found the avenue we have through the XXXX XXXX and we are pleased to be a part of the XXXX 's aviation family, however the reality is that we continue to face the consequences of the schools dishonest dealings on a daily basis and will for many years to come until we are able to pay off all of these debts and the substantial interest they 've been accruing. We sincerely appreciate any help or assistance you might be able to offer on our behalf and thank you for considering our claim and looking into this further for us.

I have had accounts with Sallie Mae for a couple years, regarding my student loans. However, throughout the past semester I have been locked out of my account a minimum of XXXX times, requiring me to call customer care and unlock my account. Then I am put on hold for absurdly long time periods for a conversation with an agitated employee that lasts about 2 minutes. Last week I tried to call because I could n't make a payment, in one day I spent over 2 hours on hold with them and never got through. I even waited for 45 minutes the last time before I finally gave up. Because I do n't have time to sit on hold, I have been unable to make a payment as I am locked out of my account. Now they call me with a recorded voice at least XXXX a day, every single day and leave voicemails. I tried to call again this morning and was put on hold for 20 minutes before I had to go to class. It is extremely frustrating, and believe me, I would like to make a payment as badly as they would like me to make a payment.

I ended up moving to another state and tried to open a local bank account, but found that the credit union has me listed with Early Warning Services as a fraud user. I have several emails with the credit union explaining if I pay the debt they can release my name from the fraud list. This violates the terms of bankruptcy code as well as Fair Credit Reporting Act.

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I wrote a letter to Capitol One stating and verifying that my credit card account was closed as of XXXX XXXX, 2015, and to stop all interest rate charges, I had this letter notarized, and I mailed it to Capitol One. I then called them for the last time, asking to be put on a remaining balance ( {$530.00} ) payment arrangement, they said no. So then, I logged into my XXXX online account, and saw that Capitol One had finally posted my remaining balance I owe, ( {$530.00} ) dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 in which I now will make XXXX $ /month payments on my own since they refused to me on the phone concerning a scheduled payment arrangement to pay the ( {$530.00} ) balance I owe. My point here and complaint is, I had to obtain and send a Notarized letter to them, or they would still be adding on interest money making the closed account balance larger which is illegal business practices, in closing, in reflect, I should and will in the future send a notarized letter dispute certified mail and the same letter regular mail ( XXXX ) and I will never ever have any more dealings with Capitol One. People are getting ripped off by these illegal business practices, word of caution, stay away from Capitol One credit card.

On XXXX XXXX 2015 I was interviewed online by a recruiter pretending to hire for a company named : XXXX XXXX XXXX based in XXXX. The job according to the job posting would consist of Data entry from home and I was directed to expect a {$2600.00} check to buy equipment for the job. The next day the check arrived at my door by express mail, I dropped it to my bank by ATM the same day but afterward I realized that the name of the company was not mentioned on the check ; I connected online with the recruiter and asked what the procedure would be after I receive the money. She said to me that I should withdraw the money and direct deposit it in another account Than I realized I was in a middle of a scam, right away I called the Bank asking if they could withdraw that check from the ATM machine and they said to me that they do not have access to the ATM system, I should wait for the operation to go through and then meet them after the check is processed, which I did on the XXXX of XXXX after the position of my account was updated with the amount of the check. The same day I went the Suntrust XXXX Branch and and the officer confirmed to me that the check is in fact a fraud. I asked her to put a hold on my account and return the money immediately. She advised me to open another account as the previous one was compromised. I followed her advice and deposited {$100.00} in the new account. She told me that the new account will be connected to my check card since the old account will be frozen till the procedure is completed, and later on closed. she said it will take XXXX business day for the new account to be connected to my online banking system. After the XXXX days, nothing went the way she told me. I called her, and she told me again that I should come to the branch and fill up a form for the connection to take place, which I did. 
From that point everything took another turn as my new personal checking account was frozen, my online banking system suspended. I could n't process any online payment since my business account was connected to my personal account through the online banking system. Since Monday XXXX XXXX I am at the branch everyday, the team-members of the branch are powerless in finding a solution to my problem. The bank has terminated my relationship, closed my old personal checking and saving account, frozen my new account, and do not want to talk to me. they have no schedule to when my money will be given back to me. I have bills to pay and my money is blocked by Suntrust bank. I am being penalized for doing the right thing. I am lost and do not know what to and I am also a victim and surprised by the action of this against me

I explained to her that I did not apply for a capital one credit card and that it is unfair for Capital One to keep the APR from XXXX from which the account was sold. XXXX XXXX said that this does not matter. She then keeps sending me this letter my personal protection account as if they are going to pay my bill for me. I told her that I do not have a problem with the personal protection account but that is not the only element that is making the payments ridiculously high and the APR!! She continues to send the personal protection letter as if they are an option for me to help pay my bill. I am not unemployed nor do I fit the criteria to receive this benefit. I am able to work and wish that she would stop sending me this letter to try to commit fraudelent claims to Personal Account Protection!!! I can pay my bill I just would like the APR lowered to a reasonable percentage.

He was not on the account and not being a cable subscriber unacquainted with the rigors of account management for this type of service. He was told that he could n't cancel for her so he told XXXX that he would stop payment. The bill was being auto-paid from her bank account and since he is on XXXX bank account when the XXXX/XXXX/15 payment of {$78.00} went out of her account he stopped payment and had the funds restored. On XXXX/XXXX/15 XXXX pulled XXXX from XXXX bank account and my brother had that refunded the next day. 

I got involved XXXX/XXXX/15 and in a compromise attempt tried to do a name change and reduction of XXXX to internet only. I refused to pay the amount they wanted for internet after cancelling phone XXXX and was pretty clear about that. XXXX actually spoke with them at this time and they claim the I was added to the account then but when XXXX handed the phone back to me the line was dead ... the call had been dropped. Knowing we could n't call them back directly we waited for them to call us back. They never did. 

Numerous calls later the account has been turned off as of XXXX/XXXX/15 and we have been sent to collections for approx. {$200.00}. I disputed the collection amount and charter has reviewed the case and credited us {$40.00} leaving a balance of {$150.00}. 

We feel like we delivered the message to turn XXXX off over and over and pretty clearly ... even if not by their requirements. My brother should have been helped to meet their requirements rather than antagonized during the XXXX call. Or if I was on the account as they claim they should have called me. 

We would like XXXX to honor the XXXX/XXXX/15 cancellation of service date.

The response stated that the 6-8 week hold on my XXXX Membership Rewards points is in line with the terms and conditions presented at the time of application. However, as I said in my first complaint, the terms and conditions state, and I quote, "" points WILL BE CREDITED to your Membership Rewards account within 6-8 weeks after charges appear on your monthly billing statement '' ( all caps emphasis mine ). However, the points have ALREADY BEEN CREDITED to my account. Therefore, the 6-8 week limit does not apply in my situation. They are listed as "" AVAILABLE '' on my account and I continually get emails and pop-up notifications from the AmEx website with reminders that I have these points and that I should use them. If they are not "" available '' they should not be listed as such. That is very deceptive on AmEx 's part and was not addressed in the response. 
The response also does not explain why ALL of my points have been frozen. In addition to the XXXX sign-up bonus from the Amex Platinum I signed up for on XXXX/XXXX/16, I had over XXXX points that I had earned from my Premier Rewards Gold card which I held prior to signing up for the XXXX XXXX ( see attachment showing the breakdown of my earning ). However, I am also not able to use those points. I tried transferring XXXX XXXX points for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I received the same error page as I have received when trying to transfer larger amounts. This is also deceiving because my points earned from my Gold card are also listed as "" AVAILABLE '' on my account landing page. I am not notified that I ca n't use ANY of my points until I get to the last step of the transfer process, which I presume to be an attempt to hide from the customer that this freeze has happened. From a company who supposedly prides itself on customer service, there is certainly not a lot of clarity from this company and I 've received only canned responses that clearly show my first complaint was not read properly.",,Amex,NV,891XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-07-18,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,2016478

I initially disputed this charge w/XXXX, by my phone call, in XX/XX/XXXX and asked for details of the charges, which I never received. I disputed the charges again XXXX XXXX ( collection agency ), who sent a demand letter, in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX and again requested a statement detailing any numbers that were called or received, and the web sites that were visited during the period while I was out of the country, and once again received nothing. My account was then passed on to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( another collection agency ) and I received a demand letter from them. I wrote to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and informed them that the charge was not valid and that I had already disputed the charge with XXXX and another agency. I explained that I received no benefit for the charges, and despite XXXX requests, I had not received anything validating the charges. I informed them that I would not respond to any more inquiries. On XXXX XXXX they signed for my certified letter and my account was reported to XXXX as a collection on XXXX XXXX. My XXXX Credit Score has just dropped from XXXX to XXXX due to this. I 've not checked, but I 'm sure that my XXXX and XXXX XXXX scores have dropped as well. I have a collection on my credit report for a medical bill which I disputed. The scenario with that bill was exactly the same. When I would dispute it with a collection agency they would drop it and then it would be sent to another agency. I finally gave up sending letters and explaining the situation over and over again. This practice has got to be in violation of the FCRA and I do not intend to have another collection on my record that is not valid. Enhanced Recovery should be shut down based on accounts that I 've read when I researched the phone number that they called from. 
Since then I received another collection letter from Enhanced Recovery Company , LLC. I have verified that they called me on XXXX and today ( XXXX ), left it ring XXXX, hung up before I could answer and left no message. The number that they called from is ( XXXX ) XXXX. I have no interest in contacting them as I have already made it clear to XXXX other collection agencies that I do not owe XXXX {$620.00} and that I requested a detailed statement which I have not received. They do not have a detailed statement as explained above. I sent a letter to XXXX requesting that they remove the collection. They did not remove it but they did indicate on the report that the account is in dispute.

After turning it in, I have received a {$600.00} bill from Hyundai for rims, tires, and "" bumper damage ''. They said they took pictures and placed them online and the damage was severe. At the dealership we walked around the car and the dealer said he saw nothing that would involve them charging me after the case for wear and tire in excess of normal. He said the rims and tires were worn and would be an issue if we did not have insurance, but since we did we were good to go with turning it in. Had I known that the insurance would not cover this when turned in we would have had it replaced first while covered, then turned the vehicle in. They are squeezing money out of us when we were paying for the coverage. We were told something by a representative of their company that apparently contradicts what they now say.

5161,2016-06-02,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"Bank of America is at it again with their overdraft fees. I check on my account at least every other day. Sometimes I do not have access to a desktop and use my mobile banking to check balances and such. They have created a new trick which allows you to see your "" account balance '' on mobile devices but apparently it 's not a true balance. I.E : the statement page shows a balance of {$25.00} but at some point over the last 24 hours unbeknownest to the customer, a debit will have hit the bank ( I know that occasionaly my auto bills will come a day or XXXX early without warning ). Bank of America hides this information on a page that is not available through mobile banking and even on the desktop is difficult to find. They then wait until they have extracted their {$35.00} fee to even send an alert giving the account holder no fair warning to be able to put funds in before the item causing the fee posts. I received an email at XXXX today, checked my account, showed an available balance of approx {$50.00} after the supposed insufficient item that triggered the fee but on their other page which is conveniently not readily available, it shows differently. This secondary tab also shows "" available balance history '' and "" statement balance ''. In other words, the balance that they give you ready access to through mobile and first sight on a desktop is completely different then what they claim your balance is. I.E : my available ending balance on the "" hidden tab '' is $ XXXX but my statement ( what I can see when checking in on my mobile device and the first screen on my website ) is {$51.00}. They deliberately hide your true balance, do n't send notifications warning of insufficient funds until the middle of the day after they have already hit you with a fee and do n't give you opportunity to get funds deposited before taking their fee ( e.g XXXX sends an immediate alert and gives you 24hrs to deposit funds before charging a fee ). I have lost over {$100.00} with this sneaky practice over the last year. I am pretty diligent about making sure money is there to cover bills but occasionally a company will post early without my knowledge creating this nightmare. If I had visibility to it when it happened and had a chance to deposit funds, there would never be an overdraft fee but as usual Bank of America has found another way to steal money off their customers.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Bank of America,CA,923XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-06-02,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1951829

I find it completely unacceptable that they can do this to this customers without any regard to the long term impact their customers will suffer from doing this. Twice, they have lowered the limit to {$29.00} above the new lower credit limit they have set for me. I started out with a limit of {$1000.00}. Then, Discover lowered it to {$780.00} and left me {$29.00} available and once again they have lowered it to {$500.00} and left me {$29.00} available. I pay my cards with the intention on being able to use them again if I should need them, but Discover Card 's activity really makes me regret working so diligently to keep things paid down. I am now preparing to purchase a second home and I have to wonder what this sudden decrease is going to do to my credit score. It is truly a sad thing that customers have no protection against the decisions of these big card companies. I do n't know if the decision to lower my available credit is based on racial profiling or not. I could understand if I was late on my payments or constantly going over my limit, but neither of those are the case. I have a great job, making $ XXXX a year, and that is not including my spouses income. I am just confused by this entire situation.

Also, as we came within a week of our closing date, we contacted our loan officer -- only to receive an automated response informing us he would be on vacation until days after our closing. After making contact with our loan officer 's supervisor, the mortgage sales manager, we were informed that pieces of information were missing and we would have to postpone our closing for another day. With that postponement, the mortgage sales manager sent us updated closing documents. On these documents, our monthly mortgage payment was listed as {$130.00} more than on the initial documents sent by the mortgage officer at least one month prior. This large difference was due to a calculation error by the mortgage officer. When this was brought to the attention of the mortgage sales manager, he refused to make any adjustments to the interest rate ( which was increased due to the non-disclosure of the impact our delayed closing would have on the rate ), fees, etc., despite conversations with the realtor and both buyers.

DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE PRACTICES Although consumer paid the account in full based on all information provided by Macy 's / Citibank on their monthly statement, Macy 's / Citibank continued to accrue interest from the date of the last statement. 
Macy 's / Citibank is engaging in unethical practices on two counts : 1. Macy 's entices its customers to apply for its branded credit card by offering instant approval and a discount for purchases made the same day the card is issued. What it does n't disclose is that it issues a billing statement on the same date that the card is issued and the first purchases are made, which guarantees most customers will miss the first payment. 
XXXX.

Specifically, by the time the consumer receives a statement, even if the consumer immediately pays in full, a small interest charge has already accumulated. The predatory aspect of this is that Macy 's / Citibank relies on the consumer 's reasonable belief that s/he has paid off the account in full.

I challenged the collection through Experian which is the only reporting agency showing the collection. XXXX sent me a letter asking for more information so they can help me with the dispute, which clearly shows they do NOT have the information needed to verify the debt to the reporting agencies. XXXX never responded to Experian, however Experian left the account on without updating, showing that the account is in dispute, it has no payment history or correct information as required by the FCRA to report on my credit. Experian is obviously allowing the miss-reporting and XXXX is blatantly using my credit report as a collection tool for a debt that is not owed. This is causing my credit score to be XXXX points lower than the others and keeping me from getting the approval for a home loan. I implore your help with getting this matter resolved in a quick manner. I am having the same issue with Enhanced Recovery as well regarding a XXXX XXXX collection for equipment that was returned long ago. Once again I disputed the account through Experian and they did not update or were they able to meet the FCRA requirements to be on my report and they are violating my rights as a consumer. Once again I ask that you help me with this matter. I have complete faith that you will get this resolved for me. I have attached the dispute results from Experian. Lastly XXXX, again is only being allowed to continue its erroneous reporting on Experian. They have not responded nor updated since XX/XX/XXXX and I have disputed the paid in full account 3 times in writing by certified mail with Experian and still they have not updated or removed the account. I have asked them to validate their verification of the debt and they have ignored my request and only send the same response that ignores my legal request as a consumer. They are obviously disregarding the law and your authority by doing this, as well as my credit reporting rights. Thank you in advance for your time in handling this matter.

After contacting the XXXX service line due to being outside of the branch 's operational hours, a Reg E dispute was submitted on my behalf, without the process/timelines/potential ramifications of said dispute being presented to me. Instead, I was placed on hold, then advised of what had been done, but still potential impacts were shared. Later in the day, I spoke to the branch manager, who advised me that she had my checks in hand, and stated that a provisional credit would be made the next day when an internal dispute reference code was received. She also indicated that there was a known issue with this ATM due to a customer having deposited cash, which had literally been buried, via this ATM. Since that time, it had not functioned correctly, but was too expensive to replace. XXXX days passed, when I received a call from the disputes team to confirm some details of the deposit, such as if an envelope was used ( it was not ), if the ATM required an enveloped ( it did not - stated that XXXX should not be used ) ... at this point, I explained that the branch manager had my checks, was waiting for the internal reference code, and I pleaded with her to wrap this up so the deposit could be processed. The next day, still no deposit was applied to my account. I called and spoke with the branch manager, XXXX, again, only this time she was much less XXXX and XXXX. In fact, she told me that I needed to "" act professionally ... to which I let her know that I am not an employee of US Bank, but instead an angry customer, whose funds were being held hostage. She responded rudely and hung up. My wife went to our local branch, and was helped by the assistant manager in the XXXX, Oregon, who called the branch where the deposit was made in an attempt to sort out the issue. She also advised my wife that every branch has a budget from which temporary credits may be issued to make things right for the customer while problems like this are being sorted out. Why we were n't provided this option, I do n't know ... particularly because they had our checks! The checks that were likely held in error due to another customer having used an envelope for their deposit - not MY issue! Even our local assistant manager was unable to get any assistance - and was advised that the branch where the deposit was made did n't have our checks! XXXX branch lied to another! After hearing this, I called and spoke with XXXX XXXX, the assistant manager, at the branch in XXXX, Oregon where I made the deposit. She offered to reach out to the back office team to see if she could get the issue resolved. Finally! Someone willing to make some effort to help resolve US Bank 's error! Within hours, XXXX XXXX had a provisional credit added to our account. This took place on Friday, XXXX, after the deposit was made on Tuesday, XXXX. On XXXX, the provisional credit was deducted from our account, and no one at US Bank was able to tell us why. My wife called customer service, but got no answers. I reached out to XXXX XXXX again, and she said she 'd get back to me.

5343,2016-03-25,Debt collection,Credit card,Disclosure verification of debt,Right to dispute notice not received,"In XXXX I applied and was approved for my first credit card/line of credit which was issued by Household Bank on behalf of XXXX XXXX. After receiving the card in the mail I activated the card via the automated system and was surprised that my balance was far less than the actual approved limit. When I called customer service, they informed me that there was an annual fee and an activation fee which was automatically taken from the available balance when I activated the card. I was very unhappy with this information and was NEVER advised of this when I applied for the card. I instructed the credit card representative to cancel out the card account, as I was not willing to pay nearly half of the available credit limit before I had even used the card. I cut the card up and never used it, but was soon receiving notices that the account had not been closed and was delinquent. I realize now how these kinds of things can affect my credit history, but at that point I had no clue about how credit worked. I figured after a few years passed I would be cleared of this obligation due to the statute of limitations. Unfortunately, it appears that the debt was sold multiple times ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). The current collector who purchased the paper on this debt on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was granted a judgment on XXXX, XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$1400.00}. The documents filed with the court indicated that my brother, XXXX XXXX, had been served a Summons for me to appear in court on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I challenge the legality of that Summons as my brother was XXXX XXXX, in XXXX XXXX that entire week on high dosage of XXXX and passed away 2 days later on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I never received that Summons or had any clue there was a judgment hearing pending against me. Fast forward to XXXX XXXX and the creditor sent me a request for interrogatories. Since I had not ever received any notice of this judgment until that time, I assumed that the statute of limitations had already expired on the old XXXX XXXX account. At any rate, I filled out the interrogatories and sent them back to the creditor and thought I would hear something back with next steps from whoever was requesting that information. Instead a Notice to XXXX XXXX for Revival of Judgment was approved by the court on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and I was not notified of that court decision until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, my employer sent me notification that the court had again granted a judgment against me on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I was completely shocked, as I had never received ANY summons to appear in court which I thought was legally required. This whole process has been confusing and it seems extremely underhanded to serve a mentally XXXX person near death and never personally serve me at any point with a Summons to appear in court. I have grown a lot personally since XXXX and now realize how important it is to pay all creditors on time. I know I did n't handle the XXXX XXXX account properly initially and have no problem taking responsibility to paying an agreed amount to the original creditor. However, it seems predatory and fraudulent that the original debt could not have been for more than {$350.00} and now a creditor has been granted permission to garnish my wages for {$8600.00}. Please help me sort through the legality of this situation. Thank you in advance for your careful consideration in this matter.

I then told him that he was just trying to get me dealt with without resolving the issue and I would definitely make the whole experiences known to others if they didb't resolve it in a satisfactory way. Then he put me on hold and then told me he would escalate me to the Concern department to issue a physical card. When I questioned him what about the outcome of last time they sent my case to the Concerns department, he just dodged my question and put me on hold again. Then came back and told me that he saw the last escalation to Concerns department, but they had not responded, and he just re-escalated again. He also confirmed my mailing address again where the card should be sent. He asked me to wait for XXXX business days to receive the physical card. 

It has since been a month, and I never received any physical or ecard, no one at American Express attempted to contact me at all. I have no way to access my remaining balance on my egift card. Now I believe no one at American Express has the true interest to solve the problem for me and let me to use my money. 

I am not sure if CFPB can help me, but I believe I need to make the extremely poor customer experiences known to other consumers and to American Express. To say the least I will NOT use any American Express for my gift card needs for a long long time.

FHA has been wrongly notified that my payments are in arrears 13 months. this is false and BOA is now attempting to foreclose and denying me fair treatment to have any modification based on my TRUE gross income of unearned income.

5413,2016-05-13,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I have spent over one year attempting to get Wells Fargo to review my financial information for modification. I was unfairly and purposely obstructed by a relationship manager named XXXX at Wells Fargo. Because of his egregious disregard for the facts my review stayed in limbo. As I got back on my feet financially and tried to resume making payments to Wells Fargo I was told that it was too late, I was too far behind and they would not accept my payment. As the process continued to drag on, the hole got deeper and deeper and now I have a sale date set for XXXX XXXX. It never should have come to this. 

I love my property, it is my dream house. It is basically a ranch, with a main house and some other cabins and structures located near the top of XXXX XXXX. In 2007 I was able to come up with a large down payment and a loan from Wells Fargo and purchased the property. Of course just a few months after I bought it the market crashed, and my business began slowing down. I was in a difficult spot but was able to hold everything together. However, I soon found that my ex-business partner had been embezzling money and found myself in dire straits and could not keep up with my mortgage payments. 

I began reaching out to Wells Fargo about 18 months ago in an attempt to get help. I could make no headway and began working with a law firm to help. My property is remote, and I do not have traditional gas, electricity or water from the utilities, instead I am set up with solar power. I get my water from a well. Because it is difficult to access my property my mail is delivered to a PO Box . My property is, in a word, OFF THE GRID. When we began the review process my relationship manager was XXXX. He claimed the file was ready for underwriter review, but needed a utility bill to move forward. We explained the situation to him that the property was off the grid ; there was no utility bill, no water bill etc. He acted like he understood what I was talking about, then after 10 minutes of explaining he said that he could not move the file forward without a utility bill. 

This went on for several months. We would continually and constantly try to convince XXXX, who was the gate keeper at Wells Fargo, of the fact that this property was OFF THE GRID and unique and the cookie cutter template conditions he normally collected did not apply. We attempted to provide him other alternate documentation to back up our assertion, but XXXX was not swayed. We could not get a manager on the phone, we could not move our file forward, and he simply did not get it. I fell further and further behind, simply because someone at Wells Fargo could not acknowledge the facts or the truth. 

I finally caught a break when Wells Fargo tried to put the house up for auction and sent an appraiser out. The appraiser was able to report back that I did live there, and that we used well water, solar power etc. we were off the grid. I was then told that Wells Fargo would do a review, but shortly after that they simply told me I did not qualify. I tried to find out why ... .one person said it was because my value came in to low. Another one told me it was because of the income. I never found exactly why I was denied, I do n't know what information they were looking at since I had sent the paperwork in so many times during the debacle with XXXX and I do not recall receiving any type of formal denial in writing. 

The bottom line is that my business has been steadily improving and my financial circumstances have changed and I qualify for help. Wells Fargo is required to give me a full and comprehensive review based on my most recent financial circumstances, and to date this has not occurred. Instead they obstructed the process for a year, and then when I proved my case that I deserved to get reviewed they rush through and just say sorry, do n't qualify",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Wells Fargo & Company,CA,920XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-05-13,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1925177

I then sent another letter with information that supports the inaccuracies that was sent by certified letter twice and still no response.

Now as for the second account. transunion is not reporting this correctly as well and i want trans union to immediately stop reporting on this account. Transunion claims that this account is valid however they have yet to send me proff of it 's validilty when i reached out to fingerhut they advised that they sold the account. so first off if this account is sold trans union should not be reporting this as a fingerhut account/ I was told that midland credit services has this account and that fingerhut is no longer responsible. XXXX services when i reached out to them advised, that they received the account they reported on the account however after receiving my formal written dispute about this fingerhut account. XXXX decided to immediately cease reporting this account. So why is transunion still reporting a sold account that no longer belongs to the original owner. They are awre that a company can not buy back and an account once it has been sold so why is this account being reported as such.

As soon as the funds on the debit card were depleted, Wells Fargo withdrew a total of {$270.00} and XXXX {$12.00} overdraft fines from my daughter 's savings account. The fraudulent charges at locations ( XXXX and XXXX ) and businesses ( fast food chains and discount grocery stores ) were inconsistent with my daughter 's spending patterns. We live in XXXX. 

I became aware of the fraudulent charges on XXXX XXXX when I uploaded transactions on XXXX, discovered the fraudulent charges and contacted Wells Fargo to shut down the card. Wells Fargo promptly refunded the full amount of fraudulent charges and bank fees. However, my specific complaint is that the bank 's fraud detection system identified and stopped fraudulent charges on XXXX XXXX but even two days later the bank neglected to : ( 1 ) alert my daughter that her card was being used fraudulently ; ( 2 ) stop subsequent fraudulent charges ; ( 3 ) stop overdraft fines ; and ( 4 ) stop fraudulent withdrawals of funds from her savings account to cover fraudulent overdrafts. Additionally, no one at the bank was willing or able to provide contact information for the consumer protection complaint I wished to file with government regulatory agencies, which again seems highly unprofessional and inconsistent with the intent of federal consumer protection law. 

Failure to notify us and also to stop fraudulent charges after an initial instance of fraud is well below the standard of practice for credit card companies. I believe that fraud prevention systems and practices should be even more responsive for debit cards given that the funds are immediately withdrawn from accounts. I am submitting this complaint because I believe Wells Fargo has an obligation to improve its fraud detection systems and staffing so that consumers receive same-day notice of suspect debit card fraud. Additionally, I believe that all banks ( not just Wells Fargo ) should be obligated to provide ( upon request ) accurate and timely information about government agencies established for consumer protection and to receive consumer complaints.

I think mortgage company is not working in good faith and doing unethical practices. I fell behind on my mortgage in last few months and been trying to catch up and have been in constant touch with Nationstar customer service department along with loss and mitigation department. Last month, in XXXX 2015, I called Nationstar 's customer department and asked for the total payoff so I can payoff the loan, however due to financial hardships on my side I was not able to pay it off and asked for an extension. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called again and talked to a customer service rep and told them that I am going to pay off the past due amount or if they can send me the total pay off amount I will try to pay off the whole loan amount..Furthermore I asked them if my loan is still current and there is no legal action on it. I was assured by the rep, that there were no red flags on my account and it was not going into foreclosure and I am good to pay by XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from the third party collection agency ( XXXX ) that my loan has been transferred to them and is under trustee 's sale. I called XXXX and was told that I need to call Nationstar for them to take their case back. 
I called Nationstar customer department again and was transferred to Loss and Mitigation department, I explained to them what I was told by their customer rep XX/XX/XXXX and was told by the customer rep that I was good to pay by XX/XX/XXXX without any legal action on my account., however they were very rude and refused to help me. Nationstar litigation department also told me they were charging me extra {$1100.00} plus {$400.00} late fees on top of third party 's collection fee. I tried to talk to various reps in that department to solve this issue however I was met over and over again with rude reps, refusing to help me, I even asked to talk to a supervisor and was refused first and then was put to his voice mail, his name XXXX, left him XXXX messages between XXXX XXXX XXXX, however no response. Few days before that, I asked their department to send me a copy of total payoff and they told me I will have it within XXXX hours, however I never got anything, I called again, and now I was told it will take 7 -10 days. I begged their department to send me that payoff and remove the legal charges because the longer I will wait for the payoff the more legal charges are getting accumulated. However again, they failed to help or address these issues and Oh my god they were rude. Today, XXXX/XXXX/15, i got the payoff details via email after calling bunch of different reps and getting different answers from each one of them. 
After expiring all my efforts to solve this matter with their customer service department and especially loss and litigation department, I am writing this letter to XXXX office for their help and to stop their unethical practices and charging me extra legal fees when I was clearly told by them that if I am paid by XX/XX/XXXX there will be no legal action taken on my account. I am reaching out for your help in this matter. I do understand that I am late in my payments and I am making a full effort to bring my account to the current status. To prove that I have worked in good faith with Nationstar to bring my account to current status I have put in several calls to Nationstar in last couple of months and kept them updated with progress on my side. 
I even told Nationstar that I accept late fees on my account since I was late in paying my payments however they need to remove the legal charges since I was told XX/XX/XXXX that My account has no red flags and I have till XX/XX/XXXX to pay it off. The legal charge third party is charging me is around {$630.00} and on top of it Nationstar is charging me {$1.00}

It was for a term of 10 years, but I wanted to accelerate the payments since it was such a small monthly payment. Every month I would pay XXXX to XXXX times the monthly payment expecting that they would apply the excess to principal. No, they DID NOT apply the excess to principal, they applied it to the coming payments. IE if I had made triple payments in XXXX, I would n't have had another due until XXXX. I called them, told them this was incorrect and their response was, "" fine, we 'll fix this. Please write FOR PRINCIPAL ONLY '' on all payments in excess of your original amount. Fine, lesson learned. The next month I wrote XXXX checks, XXXX for the amount of the XXXX mortgage and XXXX clearly marked PRINCIPAL ONLY for XXXX times the mortgage amount. The same thing happened, they applied it to the coming months payments. I again contacted them and was told that it would be taken care of. Well, this time they took three months of payments out and applied this to principal, thus putting me late for the current month 's payment. At the end of XXXX years I had a ream of notes and NO patience left with BOA. they had "" misapplied '' every XXXX OVERPAYMENT on my part to their benefit. If they did this with my payments I know they were doing the same thing with everyone else 's thus resulting in some heavy interest on their side. After two or three years of constantly fighting with them about this issue, and NEVER being able to reach the same person to fix it, I told my husband that we had to pay it off in full or I was going to have a breakdown. We did pay it and I was so happy ... until we refinanced and our primary loan was sold to BOA. It seems that the "" misapplication '' of funds has stopped ( I still pay more than the original loan so that the principal can be paid in an accelerated fashion ) but I check every month because I ca n't trust them to do the right thing. I hate BOA from the depths of my soul and if I had my way there would be many bankers in jail.

Towards the end of my lease [ I believe about 2 months before ] I took the vehicle to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, PA to attempt to purchase the vehicle. My contract allowed me to purchase the vehicle. XXXX said that the windshield was broken and it had excessive miles. They agreed that if I purchased the vehicle then the excessive miles was not a factor. So I left and I then had the windshield replaced. I then took the vehicle back to XXXX XXXX to purchase the vehicle per the terms of my lease. XXXX then refused to allow me to purchase the vehicle. I then left and telephoned Ally. Ally said they would extend the lease and allow me to contact XXXX to attempt to purchase. XXXX again refused to allow me to purchase the vehicle. The payoff on the vehicle was only {$16000.00} more or less which was far less than the value of the vehicle. I believe that they wanted my vehicle so that could then sell the vehicle for its true fair market value of {$24000.00}. They then charged me for a cracked windshield [ which I had fixed ], a non existent roof debt, an alleged tear in the interior headliner and excess mileage. XXXX XXXX and Ally failed to comply with the terms of the lease and refused to allow me to purchase the vehicle. I believe XXXX XXXX sold the vehicle for substantially more than I owed and did not allow me to mitigate my damages. I believe I do not owe them any money. They have not sued me, I wish they would so that I can prove that I do not owe them any money. What they have done is report this alleged debt on my credit report.

I then contacted Transunion and asked them to remove the item because its an inaccurate error but Transunion refused to delete it and said they had verified it. I asked Transunion the details of who they verified it with and their method of the verification. Transunion ignored my request and continued to report the inaccurate items on my credit report. I reached out to an attorney friend of mine and the FTC and they both informed me that Transunion had to give proper lawful validation to the items they were reporting and have to make sure they are accurate without errors.

5573,2016-01-17,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"XXXX/XXXX/XXXX To whom it may concern, I am writing this complaint in reference to my CareCredit/Synchrony Financial account. I opened this account initially as a CareCredit account, I believe in XXXX. 
I have a yearly {$1000.00} through my insurance for dental care, so the CareCredit was used for work above that amount. I have a {$2000.00} credit line on the card. In opening the account, it had 6 month same as cash payment terms. Which I believe as each charge that was put on the card the 6 months same as cash would apply to those terms. I have been faithfully paying the specified amount on this card since I opened it. I would use my insurance amount, and then I could only charge the amount available to the card, it never went above the {$2000.00}. Because the office would look up the available credit left on the card, then that is what was put on it additionally. The payment rose a little as each time I accrued money to the account for each time I had dental work or for use for my pets, which is fine. I understand that, but never went above the amount on the card. 
However, I had noticed about 6 months or so ago that CareCredit switched to Synchrony Financial. Since the changeover to Synchrony Financial, I noticed that the card said I had a negative balance, which I do n't understand, because as I said I paid faithfully every month, and it was never charged over the amount. My payments kept getting larger, however the balance does not change with each payment, and this has been going on for about 6 months. 
I contacted Synchrony Financial last week, and asked why my balance was n't going down. I was informed that the 6 month term had not been met, okay, I get that I may have messed up the 6 months same as cash term. I also found out that I am paying {$82.00} in interest on a {$2000.00} dollar card, with a payment of {$74.00}. And just checked and my payment again has been raised to {$76.00} this month. So ... .if the interest on the card is higher than the payment, there is no way I will ever pay this card off, how is that legal? Secondly, how can the interest be that high on a {$2000.00} card. This is utterly ridiculous!!!!!!!!! This card was supposed to be a meant to help someone, however, it has turned into a financial burden. 
XXXX XXXX offers the same kind of terms, however, if you miss the terms, the interest does NOT exceed the payment, it is added to the payment. I also have additional credit cards, and my interest does not exceed the payment, EVER!!! 
I am an honorable person, I pay my bills, however in the current state this credit card company has me in, I will never pay this off. It is as if I am just throwing my money away. Could you please assist me in finding a solution to this outrageous situation?

I had some financial issues with business and got behind in my mortgage. When I tried to make house payment they refused to take it, said I had to have XXXX payments. Next week I had XXXX payments and they refused them and said I had to have XXXX payments. This went on and on until I got help from XXXX, got caught up and this whole time I was trying to get a modification using HARP program. While this is going on my health was getting worse from the stresses they caused. I have XXXX and stress is very bad for my illness. After trying to get XXXX modification done with them, they turned me down XXXX. Started a XXXX with a agency here in Michigan, by now my health is getting real bad, I had to file for XXXX. 

I was forced to quit working because I was unable to keep up with the demands of XXXX that I owned. Sold it and paid off a couple bills. Found a local job and was fired because I was sick. Then next week social security approved me for XXXX. I have had XXXX for thirty years and always had been able to work as long as I got rest and kept my stress level down. 

When Carrington MS would n't give me a HARP modification so I could keep my house so I would n't lose all of my investment was devastating to me. Today was suppose to be a sheriff sale and they pulled it from the docket. So they are still causing XXXX situation to me. I offered them XXXX in XXXX 2015 and today it was being offered for XXXX. When my attorney made the offer they never even responded to him. That 's when I had to file bankruptcy. 

When I was trying to get the modification done they told me to call USDA rural development, Carrington claimed it was USDA was turning it down, USDA said they only guarantee the loan through XXXX bank and for me to call them. I called XXXX bank. They said they did n't have anything to do with the loan, I had to call Carrington. Called Carrington again and was told they did n't know anything and did n't even know who I should talk to but would get back to me when they figured it out. Never did call me back. I am still on the title of the property. No one seems to know who owns my house now. My real estate agent ca n't get any answers either. The fair market value is under {$30000.00}, I bought it just before the bubble in real estate collapsed.

I paid this loan in full in XXXX of XXXX. This vehicle was purchased with proceeds from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. So my obligation to Honda Financial Services ( HFS ) ended and the debt was completely liquidated at that time. I have documents to support this. 
After that fact, HFS paid an amount for vehicle taxes of approximately {$690.00} and sent me a bill. I did not agree that I owed that money to the taxing authority and liquidating that tax debt could undermine my ability to get it corrected by the taxing authority. I believe the tax was calculated incorrectly. Nevertheless I paid HFS but not after they reported me as being 30 days late on the account : an account that was paid in full. I never gave them permission to reopen the credit, nor to pay these fees on my behalf after they had no further right, title or interest in the property. I have been billed separately by the County of XXXX for taxes due on this vehicle. The amount paid by HFS is not a legitimate debt ; is related to a loan that was paid in full and they "" reopened '' the credit, on a non-revolving account without my consent and without lawful authority. I sent a letter with return receipt requested with supporting documentation. The matter was removed from my credit at that time. It has since reappeared, so I asked that it be removed. Now Honda claims it is legitimate! This is a blatant violation of not responding timely ( within 30 days ), removing the item and XXXX causing its reappearance. 
Moreover, it is not a legitimate debt. I paid that loan in full in XXXX of XXXX. How can I possibly have been 30 day delinquent in XXXX XXXX. Please help me regain my good credit. Please guide me in any further recourse I may have against Honda.

Furthermore, I did not get to drive the truck until the A/C was repaired as advertised. The car is not street legal as there are broken taillights which they promised to repair and the tag lights are also inoperable. I did not receive the truck until XX/XX/2015 with the paperwork of my financing. When I told them that I did not want the truck because this was not the advertised price, they said that I would lose the deposit and I already signed all the documentation. So then, Westlake Financial called me to ask for pay stubs. I asked them if I did not cooperate, would I still get approved for the loan. They said no. Good. Now I can get my money back.Right? Wrong! I have been lied to by every single person employed at XXXX and would like to purchase the truck at the advertised price of {$6400.00}, or return my down payment. Furthermore, they asked me to lie to the finance company -- by telling me what to say to them when they ask me questions.

They indicated that I could be placed in a repayment plan and after XXXX months, another provider would take over and I would be out of default status. At that time, I started paying {$150.00} per month. They still called constantly requesting financial info such as pay stubs, XXXX and XXXX form. They called once and stated that I needed to start paying {$1600.00} per month on this loan. I told them that I could not afford this. They continued to call and call. They then stated that I needed to pay {$900.00} per month which I stated that I could not afford. All the while, they were drafting {$150.00} per month. At XX/XX/XXXX, their XXXX XXXX indicated that I was never really in a repayment program, when I asked why they drafted my bank account monthly if I was not. She started lying at that time about how I needed to pay more. Then XXXX XXXX started calling me and stated that I need to submit more financial documentation and that my payment would be $ XXXX monthly which I agreed to. The XXXX payment due XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my pay check and that Conserve had my check garnished. I called XXXX and she asked like she knew nothing of this and stated that she needed to speak to her manager. She came back and stated that if I made payments along with the garnishment, that after a XXXX months, they would stop the garnishment. I told her that was ridiculous because my check was garnished {$450.00}. I stated that the loan was only {$3000.00}. She stated that I now owed {$5400.00} which is ridiculous. She then stated that they would offer me a XXXX settlement of {$4200.00}. This company has lied, took money illegally and was deceitful. Conserve has unfair collection practices. I called the Dept of Ed about this and they stated that any actions taken was not by them nor order by them but it was done by Conserve only. They did n't know where the increase came from and had no knowledge of how Conserve was handling the accounts for them, They redirected me to Conserve which is a waste of time since they violate all of the Fair Consumer Act. Conserve needs to made to answer for all of their collection practices. The New York XXXX has numerous complaints regarding this company. Please help the consumers who are being harassed and deceived daily by Conserve. When I questioned XXXX XXXX why I was not notified about the garnishment by them, she stated that they mail a letter to me on XX/XX/XXXX regarding this. I asked what address was it sent to and she then gave my current address. I told her that she was lying about this because I purchased a new home in XX/XX/XXXX which is the address that she stated. I was not living at this address in XX/XX/XXXX. When I stated this she became belligerent and wanted to argue with me at which time I discontinued the call.

I have requested verification of this amount, and am either ignored or sent extensive paperwork to complete. At no time has either third-party agency provided me with proof of debt. If I received anything from them that showed this was valid, I am happy to provide payment, but as my records show my last payment on the card ( which I paid in full ) was in XX/XX/XXXX, I am concerned at the paperwork stating that it was paid last in XX/XX/XXXX, years after I had moved from XXXX and last used the card. Again, I had paid this card in full and then relocated to Washington three months later. After researching both Northland Group and XXXX XXXX XXXX and learning of their less than ethical practices, I felt it necessary to report their activity.

5726,2015-07-07,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,No notice of investigation status/result,"I wish to make a formal complaint about an inquiry on my Credit File. The issue is that I applied for a Credit Card at XXXX Bank in XX/XX/XXXX in hopes to improve my credit rating and was approved but never received the card. I assumed there was a long processing time to obtain this card, but when I researched this issue at a later time I found out that they did send me a card but the address never included my apartment number so the card got lost in the mail. They then informed me that due to the delay in activating this lost card they closed the account. 
The Bank then informed me that I would have to start this process over again to obtain another card. I decided not to do this, but I have this inquiry on my credit file which gives the appearance that I have applied for credit but been denied. I wish to remove this item from my credit file to avoid any confusion from potential creditors. 
This inquiry will not be removed until XX/XX/XXXX. 
I sent a letter to Experian explaining this issue but have not receive any correspondence in resolving this issue.

5741,2016-06-25,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"Entered into a refinance transaction with PennyMac who currently holds my mortgage to get out of the current FHA loan and into a conventional loan and either remove or greatly reduce the mortgage insurance. Once the appraisal was completed, I reviewed and was shocked at where their appraiser came in at for the value. I work in the mortgage industry and have reviewed appraisals for 15+ years and knew the reconciliation was deeply flawed. Normally even though there is appraiser independence post mortgage melt down, a Lender 's internal appraisal department has the ability to review an appraisal and change the value used for lending if there are flaws in the appraisers result. PennyMac would not review and only sent my rebuttal to the appraiser who of course did not change his value conclusion and still did not provide justification for his value at the extreme low end of the market and his commentary actually supported the higher end of the market and his adjusted values for both closed sales and listings supported higher than his ultimate value. I even provided XXXX comps that were pending sales at the time of the report and also supported at least the middle of the value range if not the higher end. This is an issue for consumers especially with the resulting payment when compared with the fees and increase in principal at the end of the proposed transaction left no benefit of refinance. If I had not been in the industry I may have still proceeded with the transaction instead of cancelling as I did and been in a much worse position as the Rep never brought up the discussion on whether the new loan was still worth it with the much lower than anticipated value that left the LTV over 90 %. The only proposition brought up was to bring in {$4500.00} to pay down the principal to 90 % LTV which would lower the payment by less than {$100.00} so the money brought in would take at least 4 years to recoup and therefore makes no sense. I will attach a full breakdown of the assessment and flaws in the appraisal later in this process, but the lack of making sure the customer is put in the best position because not every appraisal will be acceptable while most are and the lack of guiding the consumer to the best situation for them financially is concerning if this were to happen to someone without industry knowledge or not financially savvy. It appeared they were just looking for a new transaction any way they could get it and if not they still held the servicing for the mortgage so either way PennyMac was set while the consumer was not.",,"PennyMac Loan Services, LLC",CA,921XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-06-25,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1983662

5871,2015-05-14,Credit card,,Rewards,,"I am writing to file a complaint against Barclays Bank Delaware ( BBD ). In particular the complaint is regarding the BBD advertised rewards program associated with their partnership with XXXX. The name of BBD product is The XXXX ( R ) XXXX Signature ( R ) Card. 

After learning about the aforementioned credit card and the rewards program associated with the product, I applied for and then received The XXXX ( R ) XXXX Signature ( R ) Card in XXXX, XXXX. The publicly advertised information claims that a cardmember will earn XXXX points after first use of the credit card and XXXX points after using the credit card to pay for a first stay at a XXXX property. My decision to apply for and receive this product was exclusively influenced by this publicly advertised material. Although incentives and promotions occasionally change, this same promotion continues to be publicly advertised and can be verified at XXXX Although not fully explained in the Offer Details, an important distinction about this rewards program that I later learned is that to utilize the points, BBD must take two actions. The first action involves BBD acknowledging the points being earned and posting the points to a cardmember 's BBD account at the end of the billing cycle. The second and equally important action involves BBD posting those same earned points to the cardmember 's XXXX account which is linked to the cardmember 's BBD account during the application process. Without BOTH actions occurring, the cardmember does not have the ability to utilize or monetize the earned points. 

The credit card was first used on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. As outlined and advertised, XXXX points were credited by BBD AND those points were posted to my XXXX account the next day after the billing cycle. However, my ongoing and agonizing issue with BBD began with trying to collect the XXXX points part of the promotion. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I charged my first stay at a XXXX property to my XXXX ( R ) XXXX Signature ( R ) Card. Unlike the delivery of the XXXX points associated with the first use promotion and despite several attempts and hours of effort trying to work with BBD in receiving and being able to utilize these earned points, BBD is now evading their responsibility to deliver on this part of the promotion. This conclusion is best characterized when I made a firm and final attempt to resolve the matter with BBD on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. At that time, I advised BBD again of the matter in writing and asked for a resolution in writing. At this point, BBD was in violation of their own Terms and Conditions since it had been 16 weeks since I fulfilled the requirement of the first stay promotion and over 6 weeks since it was posted to my BBD statement. BBD responded with what appeared to be a couple of standard platitudes and then shortly thereafter closed my complaint with no further action plan or case # for resolving the matter. In my complaint, I advised BBD that the deadline for posting the points to my XXXX account has past and should they not resolve the matter within the next two weeks, I would be left with no choice but to involve the regulatory and legal authorities. As of today, BBD continues to take no action and appears to be defiant of their responsibility to deliver on their advertised promotion. As a result, I am being deprived of reward points which would provide real economic value, if delivered in accordance with the program rules and BBD 's stated Terms and Conditions. In addition, BBD 's behavior regarding the handling of my complaint is in stark contrast with their stated Complaint Policy Statement which can be found at : https : //www.barclaycardus.com/servicing/headerLinks? handleContactUsComplaint

My complaint concerns the credit score reductions for no legitimate reason. Let me start by saying, I am not understanding why my credit score declines if someone simply inquires as to what it is. If my credit score is XXXX and someone runs my credit to see if I qualify for credit with them, it brings my score down XXXX points, which now means my score is XXXX. This seems so unfair to me. A credit score should be diminished for failure to pay, slow payment, or bankruptcy. A credit score should not be decreased because someone inquires as to what it is. Example : : I decide to purchase a home, they run my credit, it is XXXX, borderline fair and poor. That lender is not meeting my needs and I decide to change lenders, and the new lender runs my credit and it has gone down XXXX points to XXXX which is now reflect the score as poor, which now means I ca n't get a house at all because my score has to be at least XXXX. I have not done anything wrong to cause this. I have not failed to pay anyone, or been delinquent with any payments. It 's as though you 're taking away my right to change my mind, and destroying my chance at home ownership just because of a credit inquiry. It does not seem to me that the services are making any money when a business inquires as to what your score is. If that is not correct, please enlighten me. This is a matter that needs some serious revamping, not later but as soon as possible. It is unfair to all consumers, whether the credit score is XXXX or XXXX. I will be sending this request for change to you every day until my voice is heard and also looking for other sources to voice my complaint to in the meantime.

The servicer, in moving to foreclose, was required to go through Mediation by Oregon Law. In this process we applied for a mortgage modification to allow us to stay in our home. First HAMP was denied ( see attached for reasons- they gave us no information about how they arrived at not being able to fit a modification into the XXXX-XXXX % DTI ). Then we were denied for an in-house modification for the reason that the LTV was less than 70 %. This calculation is only based on the original loan balance and a drive-by BPO ( of which there were XXXX that varied by XXXX % in their valuation ). The holder of the loan is unwilling to consider the back interest and tax/insurance escrow owed in the basis of their calculation. If they did, the LTV would be between XXXX- XXXX %, depending on which BPO was used, well within their "" standards ''. Their method seems a logical fallacy. Either the additional debt owed to them should increase the base loan or reduce the value of the home, because the net result is they we have less equity.

When I called, I was told that because the credit card was no longer interest free, the amount of the convenience check and whatever charges I had would be combined and I would be charged at the rate of the credit card. I stopped using the card and was still charged interest. 
What I learned today is that my monthly payments were allocated toward paying off the convenience check, that carried no interest, instead of the credit card charges which of course carried interest. I was never given a choice on how to allocate my payments. It is my understanding that consumers should at least be told when this is happening. Instead, the representative explained that it 's buried somewhere in the credit card agreement that I agreed to let SunTrust make that choice for me. 
I pay my credit cards in full every month. I have been charged a fee to use the convenience check, and then charged interest every month. This appears to be deceptive at best. And SunTrust is unwilling to make any adjustments.

Apparently the Indiana State Department of Revenue put a black mark on my credit report indicating I had not paid my taxes, when actually they were paid in full on time. When I found out about this I went ahead and filed the tax return requesting my refund which the state then sent me. Now however, I ca n't get them to take the negative off of my credit report which incorrectly states I did n't pay them {$2700.00}. The money was taken out of my regular paychecks and was never overdue. I believe the State has now corrected their records to show this but still needs to remove the inaccurate negative information from my credit report. They did remove it from one credit agency but has declined to remove it from Experian.

I would like to find a way to avoid this default, as I have no history of missing payments on any loans and I have every intention of paying the loan back. Either to start paying immediately to keep the loan out of default, for my cosigner to be removed from the loan, or the loan to be put in a status where I can get a consolidation loan from another lender. 

I realize that bankruptcy laws prevent most of this information from being disclosed, but I would like to get this loan into good standing and continue paying.

Since I had a conventional loan originally, I qualified to have my PMI removed after 2 years. I submitted the PMI removal request to Nationstar officially on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. They initially tried to tell me that I could not have it removed because of a late payment on the account, which happened only at the time that Nationstar initially transferred the loan over from XXXX, which happened without my knowledge. I made the XXXX payment to XXXX, they never cashed it, and the payment was never sent to Nationstar. I had been in communication with Nationstar all along about this, and even though the "" official '' payment was a few days late, they agreed to not charge any late fees because they were aware of the miscommunication between the XXXX mortgage companies and I. Regardless, I waited until the official "" wait time '' of 1 year with no delayed payments to check on the status, and after I called them today, they stated that my current Loan to Value ratio is at 90 %. When I asked them how they got to this figure, no one was able to answer that question for me. One person was able to give me the initial appraised value of my home at the time of purchase in XXXX, which placed my LTV ratio at 78 %, but still, no one could answer that 90 % amount, and they stated that if I wanted to remove the PMI, then all I needed to do was pay {$60000.00} toward my loan and then it might be removed. After going through XXXX different departments, I was finally told that I now need to re-submit the PMI removal request, and that they would send me a new form ( which i still have not received ) and start the entire process all over again. At this point, it is clear that they have no intention of removing the PMI from my account.

6369,2015-04-04,Debt collection,I do not know,Disclosure verification of debt,Not given enough info to verify debt,"I discovered inaccurate information placed on my credit report by Portfolio Recovery Associates. I immediately took action. I called all XXXX credit bureaus and made them aware of the situation. As a result, they disputed the account. A week later Portfolio Recovery Associates responded to XXXX, electronically, stating "" the account will remain on credit report. '' This raised even more concerns!! I did n't think companies could report inaccurate information on people 's credit and get away with it!! So, I sought out legal advice. I was made aware that I could write Portfolio Recovery Associates and demand that they send me legal proof and documentaion of the debt, Debt Validation. I was also warned to send my request certified mail to be sure they received it and could n't claim they did not. I am aware that Portfolio Recovery Associates have XXXX days from the date they receive my letter to respond with the legal documentaion.. I sent XXXX letters to Portfolio Recovery Associates, each certified, XXXX to their corporate location and the other to the location listed on my credit report. XXXX letters were received and signed for at each location on XXXX/XXXX/2015. XXXX was singed for at XXXX XXXX and the other at XXXX XXXX. the clock started on that date. XXXX DAYS LATER, STILL NO RESPONSE!! I never received a response from the company!! I am now demading the immediate and complete removal of any account reported on my credit report by Portfolio Recovery Associates. Portfolio has failed to send the legally required validation of debt. their firm has violated the law!! The Consumer Credit Protection Act, The Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Plus many more. Portfolio Recovery Associates have communicated and continue to communicate incorrect and defamatory information to third parties and the XXXX major credit bureaus. It is time for this to stop! I have suffered and cotinue to suffer damages. I am very upset at their firm 's business practices. I have suffered emotional distress from this. I am demanding that they delete any items they are reporting from my credit as soon as they receive this response from cfpb! Hopefuly they will respond to you guys because they have refused to do so with me.

XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016 I went to a MoneyGram location in XXXX IL with the intend to send ~ {$1500.00} ( XXXX ) to a Friend of mine in XXXX . I talked on their red phone that they have at that location, that someone automatically answers to guide you with the transaction. 
After I confirmed my name, my friends name and location, the Transfer in Minutes fee for sending {$1500.00} was {$80.00}. So I agree to that and pay the money, I got a Reference # XXXX and they said the money should be available to pick up in XXXX in a mater of minutes. But that never happened because the second day XXXX XXXX I called moneyGram to check the status of the transaction and they said the transaction is under review and that they need to transfer me to a different department that has some question for me. So they transfer me and I waited 20 min and nobody answered.I called 2nd time after ~1h and same story I was transferred to this department that never answers ... and waited for ~32 min this time ... still no answer so I give up. XXXX XXXX in the evening I go to a money gram location next to my house to try to get some answers, I used their Red phone again and guess what, same story I had to wait to talk to this department and they said it may take more the 40 min or 1 hour. So I told them that in this case I just want to cancel the tansaction, because it is not money in minutes transaction anymore, almost a full day past by and I spent XXXX on the phone trying to understand what do they need to review. 
XXXX day the XXXX XXXX 2016 I called them again, same story this time they transfer me and this department finally picked up after just ~15 min waiting for them. And they asked me the same question that they had asked me when I first made the transaction on the phone, my name, my friends name ( the receiver ) and so on ... that finally they come up with this reason that the transaction has to much risk and that they will refund my the money. Now I got a new reference # that I hope I can use it to get my money back, I have not got to and MoneyGram office yet. So this was after min ~ 35 h from when I made the transaction and payed the money for it. So the SCAM that MoneyGram IS DOING is that they have use my money ~ $ XXXX {$80.00} fee ) for ~35 h and as they work almost all over the world they probably do this for XXXX of people like me and are able to block huge amount of money just for at least 24 h so they can collect interest on it or invest the money or whatever. For a service that is called money transfer in minutest that actually blocks your own money for more then 24 h that is outrageous and most probably illegal. I relay appreciate if you will take note of this fact and start investigating Money Gram. 

I WILL NEVER USE MONEYGRAM SERVICE AGAIN

6487,2015-03-23,Mortgage,VA mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I purchased my home in XXXX. The financier is no longer in business. XXXX XXXX was the servicer. I was XXXX retired in XXXX and refinanced with Countrywide toward the end of XXXX because of financial difficulties. XXXX of XXXX Bank of America coaxed me into refi-ing with them due to low interest rates. In XXXX I faced a financial hardship due to a relationship ending. I was told I would n't qualify for a modification until I was 4 to 6 months behind on my mortgage payments. Once I was finally accepted into a trial period I discovered my mortgage was not valid as it had been separated from the promissory note in order for BOA to securitize and sell it as well as capitalizing on the promissory note by selling and or securitizing to sell once or many times over. My mortgage is a VA backed mortgage and XXXX XXXX was the holder or trustee of the mortgage note security. XXXX XXXX most likely held the promissory note as well. Being that XXXX XXXX is government run I have no way to get and or trace any promissory note securitizing information and can not get the mortgage security tracking information as well. I asked the bank to provide this info but have not received it. When I asked for and tried to get back the money/interest the bank made off of my signature on the promissory note, I was denied and not provided with any ability to appeal and now the 3 year statute of limitations has passed and the bank has claimed my money and interest money made from the promissory note as abandoned to claim it for themselves. Incidentally or additionally BOA owes me interest and money on all transactions that I made through BOA via checks written, credit card use and debt card use ( except for withdrawing money ) before 3 years from now as they were all securities I created with my signature and the bank did n't disclose this to me or pay me. 
They filed an assignment of mortgage through MERS to my county ( XXXX XXXX, FL ) public records that has been verified robo signed, fraudulent and was filed after sanctions, regulations, judgments and laws expressly disallowed this type of mortgage assignment. 
I feel BOA should be required to reimburse or pay me at least 30 % of the profits made from my promissory note, mortgage note regardless of the statute of limitations. They made money from my signature without disclosing it to me and not sharing any of the profit ... time to pay up. 
The loan modification papers would have stripped me of most if not all rights, consumer rights and home owner rights. 
They are currently trying to get me to accept a new loan modification. The wording is vague and does not state exactly and explicitly that I am or will qualify for a permanent modification and what the new mortgage amount will be as well as monthly amount due. It will be worded again to strip me of all my rights despite having an attorney and the court overseeing it. I feel or allege that BOA will wait a few months after the permanent mod and inform me that I no longer qualify for the mod and they are foreclosing but I wo n't have any legal recourse because of the signed mod contract. My refi was done XXXX XXXX and thus does n't qualify for any of the settlement modifications so I know it will be canceled. 
Also note that the refi date was after the bank bail out and sanctions, regulations and laws were put into place that should have prevented them from separating the notes and making significant amounts of money off of me and my notes without my knowledge. 
I understand that BOA was not held accountable or liable for their practices because of all who were involved and that it is unfair to make the courts deal with these issues and the courts are forced to decide whose toes they have to step on ... which is usually the home owner as they do n't have the money and power the bank does. That does n't make it right for BOA to act above the law or allowed to.

I have a credit card with Navy Federal Credit Union I have been trying to pay off, and always make my payments WITHIN 30 days of the due date. Usually my payments are made within 10 days because of the date my military pay check comes in versus the date they have for my payment to be due. I always make my payment on the XXXX of the month and the due date is on the XXXX of the following month ( ie : due date is XXXX XXXX, I make payment on XXXX XXXX when the military pays me. ) The reason I took out the credit card was because last year I hit financial hardship and had to pay for my moms bills because she was in a XXXX and out of work, as well as had to pay for a surgery for my dog who was in an accident as well. I 've spent the past year playing catchup and finally have caught up bht I always made my payments on the credit card within 30 days so it would n't be considered delinquent. However, somehow Navy Federal Credit Union made the account delinquent and reported it, so now it is having a negative impact on my credit that I worked hard to obtain and build. I can not refinance my truck to make my payments lower to save more money because of a report that was made before the 30 day period. I would like to find out why this was put on my credit report and see if I can get it taken off because it is negatively impacting my credit. I have a car payment, a mortgage both of which are always payed on time to the day, as well as have a small loan with another compan that is payed on to the day. No other bills are late either. The only account there is an issue with is the navy federal account that reported delinquent without thirty days and whom charge me double interest rates that make it hard to make any headway on the card. I am XXXX military and am coming on my XXXX year in. Refinancing a truck I make payments on on time should n't be an issue but it is because Navy Federal Credit Union is holding my account delinquent.

6520,2015-11-25,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"I hired a Real Estate Company that specialize in doing short sales to initiate a short sale request to my mortgage company, Franklin American Mortgage XXXX was on XX/XX/2015.Franklin American has given misinformation and has been completely unwilling to assist in this matter since starting the process, even though they claim this is an option they make available to homeowners going through a Hardship. In the last year, I have lost my job and been separated from my wife. I am currently trying to find a new job but have been unsuccessful so far. The reason for my complaint is simple, i believe that my mortgage company is forcing me into foreclosure. There is a scheduled auction date for XXXX/XXXX/15. I have been trying to obtain a payoff quote from the foreclosure attorneys to find out what the exact amount is since XXXX/XXXX/15. The foreclosure attorneys continue to advise both me and my realtor that there is nothing the attorney can do to expedite this quote to be generated. The advised that they were still waiting for Franklin American to send it back to them. They advised that it usually only takes 3-5 days and this was unusually long. As of today, XXXX/XXXX/15, i still have no idea how much to pay off my loan in full. They are foreclosing XXXX/XXXX/15. Another reason i believe i am being forced into foreclosure ; My house was flooded ( twice actually ) and there was an Insurance Claim made. I tried to get Franklin American to sign the insurance check and send back to me. The check had to be signed by both parties. They misled me and seemingly just jerked me around until the check expired. I am currently trying to get the claim and check extended. If i could repair the damage to the property, i would be able to sell the house traditionally and avoid foreclosure or any other kind of pre-foreclosure option that would hurt my credit. It feels like they are well aware of my situation, the fact that there is equity in my home but have fallen back on payments due to losing my job, and have decided that Franklin American is going to take the house to auction XXXX/XXXX/2015. Another reason i believe i am being unfairly forced into foreclosure, the real estate brokerage that i hired specializes in short sales, has run into nothing but deception and misinformation. After the bank postponed the XXXX/XXXX/15 foreclosure date upon my realtor initiating the short sale review, they ordered an Appraisal and requested specific documents to complete the package. The documents requested were faxed in on XXXX/XXXX/15. They advised that the package was just reviewed on XXXX/XXXX/15, 9 days later. The account was noted as follows : "" Documents reviewed, NO time to do a short sale because of the XXXX/XXXX/15 F/C. Reason : Incomplete package. "" They said because we did not put an address on line XXXX of the IRS XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) This is the line were the address Franklin American is requesting the IRS send the transcript to. ( Like i could know this! ) My real estate company called to ask why they would n't allow us to put the address on the XXXX and send it back. They stated that there was a LAW that states the a "" complete short sale package '' must be received within more the 14 days of a scheduled sale date. The account was noted incomplete on XX/XX/XXXX, the realtor was advised of this on XX/XX/XXXX, and the sale date is for XX/XX/2015.My real estate company is advising me that there is CERTAINLY NO LAW regarding any amount of days that a mortgage lender must receive a borrower 's short sale package for review. My friend, who is a Real Estate attorney, has also confirmed to me that there is no such law, nor government implemented guidelines that apply to this situation and that banks can choose their own short sale process.I am requesting that someone please investigate the recent history of events to determine whether i am being illegally or unethically taken of advantage. Thank you for any help

history : on approximately XXXX XX/XX/2015, a CapitalOne Fraud rep left a message saying me asking if I recently applied for a credit card. when i went online to get their fraud department, they said i was not responsible and not to worry. 

Then on XXXX XXXX, 2015, a CapitalOne fraud rep named XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ext. XXXX ) started asking me aggressively with more personal questions, which i felt awkward giving out, I told her i would call back. When i called their main fraud line at XXXX, they said my case was closed and that XXXX XXXX probably did n't have the right information and not to worry that everything was closed. XXXX XXXX XXXX then called me back and said I needed to answer all these personal questions and i told her i just got off the phone with her team and was assured everything was closed so she replied, "" fine, you will be responsible for all charges now '' then hung up. 

In my mailbox, i was sent a letter from CapitalOne Fraud via XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that they completed their investigation and have found that I am responsible and I owe {$3500.00}. I was tempted to call her back but called their XXXX main Fraud line and again, their rep said I am not responsible? It seems like CapitalOne has so many layers within their organization, let alone their own Fraud department, that I keep having to talk to multiple people who either ( a ) says I am responsible, which i am not or ( b ) who says to ignore their own department and that I am not responsible. Now I am getting the run around and not sure what to do here. 

Please have someone who can tell XXXX XXXX to close my "" made up account '' - that I did not open and stop harassing me. in fact, i would think CapitalOne would train their Fraud department not to harass the people that are victims. You guys should have my number based on the case # i provided.

When I began paying back my student loans XXXX have never missed a payment ) in XX/XX/XXXX I had up to XXXX XXXX month forbearance periods available to me. In XX/XX/XXXX I became unemployed and reached out to my lending institution letting them know that I would like to opt for the XXXX month forbearance available to me. They told me that they were no longer offering these forbearance periods and I would need to figure out how to pay. For XXXX months I barely made my payments of {$600.00} per month on unemployment checks ; until I was lucky enough to find employment again. I feel violated by those periods of forbearance being taken away from me. Those periods of time were a safety net for me as a financially independent young adult who holds {$80000.00} in private debt. Is the institution allowed to do this without notifying me? If they did notify me in a monthly payment contract opt in is that predatory?

I called the XXXX XXXX on the recorded line. After identifying myself through their automated system and changing my pin #, I was connected with XXXX, a represntative. I reviewed my difficulty with XXXX and he asked if he could ask me questions through public recored to confirm my identity. Although, I was confused why they would use public record as a means to confim my identity, but nevertheless I agreed. He asked me my name, address, and social security number. After a pause, he stated that he could no longer help me and that I needed to go to a branch. I was astonished that these were the "" tough '' security questions that he asked and even more surprised that his service solution was for me to leave work and go to a branch. Clearly those questions are the very bare bones of identifying someone and I expected a deeper inquiry but received none. I asked to speak to a supervisor and XXXX stated that the supervisor would only state the same thing he did and that XXXX ( actually XXXX ) did not wish to take my call. I insisted and asked to wait to speak to a person in charge. i re-iterated that I did not wish to cause any trouble but wanted help to my issue and not deal with a branch. XXXX eventually picked up my call after the transfer and I reviewed my issue with her. She blamed the "" system '' that her and XXXX use and stated their was nothing further to be done. I begged her to please ask me more difficult questions but they declined. I was open to alternatives to resolve this but XXXX and XXXX were not even remotely interested in exploring any other means. Remember, i was able to change my pin but they could n't ask me the amount of my HELOC payment. I told them that their service was poor and uncreative in spite of a basic request. I asked for her supervisor as I desired to provide sorely needed feedback and to explore further assistance if possible. I received no name, no phone number, no email to which I could address my complaint. I did receive a Client relations address to hand write a letter to. I also asked why she told XXXX that she did not wish to speak to me and or hear about my issue. She denied that that happened and in turn made XXXX a liar. Please remember this was a recored line, so there should be no dispute about any of this.

I took out XXXX then 4 days later they said XXXX money orders came back bad .I went to bank with XXXX to pay for all the MoneyOrders. even thou the last one still was n't back. The banker took the balance of the XXXX money orders and put the rest into my acct. Knowing that the last money order was coming back as well. The next day I called to inquire about the last money order and was told that it came back and it was clear. So I used the money in my acct. And XXXX days later they called and said that the last money order came back bad. I was threaten that if I did n't pay for money orders it would come out of my ssi that 's direct deposited I refused to pay the last of the money order so they turned me into check systems. but I was removed and beat that. I was n't aware that the money orders were part of a scam. So I was a victim and then the back lousey excuse for there failure is more then impossible to believe. It still haunts me today. I tried to do the right thing and the bank made it worse then the scammer. They tried to deny that the bank told me the last money order was clear. It was a lie because when I was over drawn for the XXXX money orders they blocked my atm card until I paid the balance they activated it again well that bite it did n't work so that 's when I called the bank to see why and that 's when they told me that last money order was cleared. And apparently it was n't according to there statement. But the atm alloys me to take XXXX extra from it. Does n't make any since the atm will not do that. They were holding on to this last m money order until I spent the money. It does n't make "" since if there was XXXX money orders only XXXX came back. No way ... this is how I came to be aware of the debit credit that they all of a sudden made up. There is no such thing and everybody who has one is being ripped off. If you look on most banks web sites they donot say anyhing about a bedit credit card.only is it a credit card is when you ca n't put your pin no. In for a transaction. Who new this?? Who new that when you pay your Bill 's at home or online that they are n't being paid for maybe XXXX days. That your money comes out of the bank and made a iou slip until the merchant comes picked it up. In the mean time use your card as debit and you can use the money you had for Bill 's. Then you become overdrawn and the bank charges you a fee. Its ironic how America waant aware of banks doing this to your card. I knowv citibank and XXXX XXXX XXXX does n't even mention this type of card. it 's either a debit card or a atm card. Wake up America the banks are stealing your money and living on your bank fees..

My XXXX XXXX XXXX truck was illegally reposed XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX out of XXXX Alabama. This was my deceased husband truck who passed away XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. My XXXX year old daughter inherited my deceased husbands truck when he passed away. In XXXX I received the title and XXXX letters from USAA that truck was paid in full. USAA claims they have no documents on the truck and I have no contract it is a done deal. They stated I have to talk to XXXX and XXXX. They also stated I have a contract with these companies. I have asked for proof and sent XXXX certified and also a XXXX page fax. As of today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX no debt has been proven to me. My vehicle has been stolen from me and I do plan to go forward and sue and what I have learned XXXX companies are involved with this criminal matter. XXXX from XXXX stated they are going to auction my XXXX XXXX XXXX my property who I have the certificate of title and XXXX letters from the bank. This has done an emotional number on myself and my XXXX daughters. I do hope you look in to this and demand the auction to be stopped and my stolen property to be returned ASAP! I have also put a lien on this vehicle as I am the true and only owner. I have also been to the Probate office and they also stated I was the true and only owner per XXXX XXXX. It was also brought to my attention the title was transferred in to my name XXXX XXXX. I find this odd as I had this done when my husband passed away XXXX/XXXX/XXXX he was a veteran served his country and this is the thanks his family receives. I want my stolen property returned tomorrow. I also do n't recall giving permission to these copies to trademark my name or copyright. Please take care of My XXXX XXXX XXXX asap. If Securitisation is illegal under US legislation - primarily because it is fraudulent and causes specific violations of R.I.C.O., usury, Antitrust and bankruptcy laws. And it flies in the face of public policy in numerous ways, as is expounded in extensive detail in an analysis to be published in our journal Economic Intelligence Review XXXX ( XXXX ) with several pages of book, article and case references. 

To begin with, securitisation violates US State usury legislation. Secondly, all 'true-sale ', 'disguised loan ' as well as 'assignment ' securitisations are essentially tax evasion schemes, and the penalties for tax evasion in the United States are excessively severe.

I called & was told the hold was XXXX/XXXX/2016 because "" there was a problem with the check ''. They could n't tell me what the problem was. I had a copy of the check, no problems. I was told to call the Insurance Company, that my bank had not called & I was sent a letter to call the Insurance company and to allow 10 days for the letter to be received. No joke! They actually said that! 
I called the insurance company, they confirmed check was paid out on XXXX/XXXX/2016. I called wells fargo again after receiving confirmation the check was cleared, cashed and funds sent, to be told that wells fargo was waiting for confirmation from the Insurance Company 's bank that they would "" confirm that they were not going to pull the funds back ''. Are you serious?? This policy of a 10 day hold on money that they have already received and are holding is just stupid! One phone call to them for verification of this supposed pull back release would have made wells fargo "" a personal bank ''. Tell me why. I do n't believe the XXXX people I spoke with at the bank. After getting to the XXXX superviser I was told the check did n't clear, the paper check, but that they had the funds on hold. I do n't know ANY bank that would send funds without clearing a check. I do n't believe banks send money out of the goodness of their hearts! They want guarantee 10 days later that the funds are good? That does n't make sense! The bank said I could file a claim, that would take 5 days. LOL Wells Fargo is holding funds 10 days on paper checks. There is nothing that can be done! They have the money, can use the money for 10 days before they release to account holders. I was told Direct Deposits are never held. Is that because they are a Federal Transfer? If Wells Fargo needs a "" pull back release '' on all paper checks, why is n't this information given to account holders to deposit along with the checks?? Like an indemnity policy, that the check is good. lol Or a Federal Stamp of some kind from the issue bank? Is n't that FDIC guarantee for a check? 

I believe Wells Fargo should be investigated for unfair business policy in regards to 3rd party paper checks. That this "" Pull Back Release '' needs to be investigated. I do n't believe it 's real. Wells Fargo should be slapped with a Federal fine for withholding accountholders funds without reason on funds received and already in their possession.

6733,2016-06-26,Credit card,,Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2016 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX To whom it may concern, The morning of XXXX XXXX, 2016 I had walked into the Wells Fargo located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX for an appointment with a Personal Banker by the name of XXXX XXXX. The intention of the meeting was to open up a business checking account and submit an application for a Home Equity Line of Credit. This intention was discussed in advance via e-mails and phone calls. 
During the meeting, I had let XXXX know of my current job position as a Credit Risk Analyst at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had also disclosed that I used to work for Wells Fargo in several positions including that of Personal Banker. I notified XXXX of my current financial needs and answered her questions for my Home Equity Line of Credit to the best of my knowledge. I brought in all requested paperwork for proof of my financial situation needed in underwriting ( tax returns, paystubs, bank statements, etc. ) Further into the meeting, I was offered a business credit card in which I stated I had no need for. I was pressured by XXXX to open it as she continued to sell me reason after reason on why I would need that card. I told her that I already have several business credit cards and have absolutely no need for another card. She stated that Wells Fargo already ran my credit so I did n't have to worry about another inquiry. I replied that an inquiry is not my concern, it was having a new account that I had no use for and that my current credit exposure is already too high and affecting my credit score. I also stated that I would be buying a new car by the end of the year and would n't want to chance any credit score deterioration to affect my rate. My answer was a firm "" NO ''. 
Fast-forward to Saturday, XXXX XXXX, 2016. I go to check my mail and to my surprise I find a business credit card from Wells Fargo with a credit line of {$10000.00}. The exact card I remember saying no to! I promptly call the banker at XXXX that day to complain. She returns my call at XXXX, but it goes to voicemail as I had left my phone in the car while at the gym. Her voicemail states she did not open the card, and if she did, it was by slip of the hand. I called her back at around XXXX that same day and reminded her that I used to work her position and I know what she was telling me was simply not true. I signed documents allowing only for new business accounts ( checking and savings ) and for the Home Equity Line of Credit. The signature was in an electronic box which is customary for Wells Fargo Banking practices. XXXX explained to me what each signature was for and I took her at her word. I have then checked the copies of documents provided by XXXX that was handed over to me in a Wells Fargo folder at the conclusion of our meeting. There were no documents pertaining to the Credit Card to be found. I have no idea how they opened up a business credit card without my signature. Whether it was forged or if they used XXXX of my other applications to apply for the card. 
I will be pursuing removal of this new account on all credit bureaus it has been reported to. I will be calling the Branch Manager on XXXX XXXX, 2016 ( one day after this complaint submission to demand an explanation of his/her banker 's actions ). Please assist me in rectifying this matter.

I was only able to obtain a XXXX XXXX number from the XXXX company, as neither has a website or any contact information other than a phone number.

At that point my instinct told me these people are desperate, I should not do this. 
So I called credit card company to thanks him for looking out for me. told him I change my mind about this transaction, please do not let them charge me {$400.00} to my card. I called back American Vacation and told them I change my mind about this purchase. They said no problem. 
A couple of day later, I saw a charge on my activity list on the credit card web site. I called the credit card company again and asking why you guys let this charge go through.They charge with different name or their sister company but the the same amount of {$400.00} that I called you to put a block on. But he said I could dispute that and we could resolve it later. 

Later, I talked to customer service specialist on the phone a few times. He send me some copy from XXXX XXXX claiming that I did sign an agreement electronically. that was a lie. I did n't sign anything. On that paper, they had my last name wrong. they even sign my name wrong. I wrote to the customer service XXXX that handle my case. He said sorry he decided that it is all valid. I disputed again another customer service specialist looked over again and she agree with the first one. 
I later found out that that travel company is form out side of United State. I could n't even find it on internet. They must do this kind of stuff all the time. BUT the credit card company is support to protect their customer. '' My credit card not yet been charge. I called to block it. They still let it go through. '' And later on even with wrong name and wrong signature, they still decided it was valid. I pay {$95.00} a year for this credit card service for what? So they could XXXX me?

The letter stated we had 45 days to purchase flood insurance. We immediately began the process. Our insurance company, XXXX, told us that all flood insurance policies have a mandatory wait period of 30 days. We experienced enormous difficulty getting proof of insurance to Quicken - despite numerous calls, email and fax attempts and various Quicken employees confirming receipt of the insurance policy and assurance that all was well. Despite that, Quicken force purchased flood insurance with a start date of XXXX XXXX, 2015 - a full 3 weeks before they even sent us the letter! Eventually they removed the policy, continuing to hold us responsible for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX - the months we either did n't know or were mandatorily blocked out with the wait period. The two months that Quicken has retroactively forced flood insurance is only slightly below the quote we received for a full year policy from XXXX. That only began our problems with Quicken. The quest to understand changes and charges to our mortgage began in XXXX 2015 and sadly continues still. I can not say how many times, more than dozens, I 've called and emailed asking very specific questions to understand the costs and changes to our mortgage payments on a fixed rate loan. I can not understand how a financial institution does not know this information at the touch of a button and why it has been taking so long and still no information is known. Our mortgage payments have fluctuated and increased by several hundred dollars a month! We need help getting specific details of costs and really want to spread the word on Quicken 's shady business practices. We could not regret more our decision to refinance with them. Having a mortgage on this property for 11 years with never a problem before Quicken really says something about them.

6764,2015-07-24,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"We are in a crisis ... My Brother in law who is a XXXX in the XXXX area suggested I contact you, because what I shared with him about what my husband and I have been dealing with for years was very disturbing to him. Our Loan Servicer is Ocwen and we have a very convoluted and complex situation. Over a year and a half ago, our Home Owners Association ( XXXX lien holder subject to our Mtg.Co. ) here in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, foreclosed on our home after negotiations to work out a payment plan fail through and they denied what we could afford monthly. This was a XXXX HOA F/C on our property since XXXX. In XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the assigned Trustee, for virtually thousands of HOA F/C in XXXX XXXX, immediately accelerated the F/C and the investor, XXXX XXXX, XXXX , who won the bid for approx. {$9000.00}. for a {$200000.00} home, immediately went to the Records Dept. and changed the Deed to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, with out a Title Company processing the Title which would have required our signatures. We made numerous calls to Ocwen Loan Servicing to inform them of what was taking place, making them aware that this Investor would be demanding we sign a Lease Agreement with him for a certain amount of rent each month, or he would threaten to evict us. When the XXXX days was up, we received notice demanding {$18000.00} ( double his investment ) upfront and if we wanted to stay in the home we would have to sign a lease for {$1800.00} a month. XXXX XXXX, with XXXX XXXX, scheduled an appointment with us, after realizing the home would need slab work, our A/C went out @ the expense of {$2500.00} he agreed to let us lease for less without the down payment. We work out of our home & felt vulnerable to his demands.We have been leasing from him from month to month since XXXX XXXX, XXXX. During this time Ocwen was notified of what XXXX XXXX was doing & XXXX had their attorney 's contacted him to try to resolve this. However, the attorney 's and XXXX XXXX went back and forth filing suits for months, so that XXXX XXXX could prolong our lease. It 's been a year now, and just a month ago we started receiving F/C ads in the mail and calls from Ocwen began again, wanting to send us Loan Modification papers. We realized that something must be happening. The Attorney 's for XXXX/Ocwen had not notified us, so we decided to call XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX, XXXX, attorney 's for XXXX/Ocwen. They informed us of a recent ruling from the lawsuit that was between XXXX/Ocwen & XXXX, XXXX, XXXX.The judge in the XXXX County Courthouse dismissed the case without prejudice, sighting the original HOA F/C was a XXXX Lien holder and subject to the XXXX Lien holder which is XXXX.We had questioned this many times with Ocwen reps. but no one would do anything about it. Recently on the phone with XXXX of the clerks in the XXXX department for XXXX, I informed them that we had not gotten any notice of F/C, but we were aware through the mail ads of a sale date for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. She put me through to an attorney and she explained the ruling against XXXX, XXXX. XXXX, and said that the date set was in error because they had not sent out the notification of a F/C Sale Date to us. They registered the letter for the sale date for the F/C sale on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. which we had to pick up at the Post Office. We have been through some hard times, and through some unique turn of events that effected our situation, which is to much to explain here ... Ocwen has inflated our original loan from {$100000.00} to now at {$260000.00}. Our home is valued at {$200000.00}. The investor XXXX XXXX, whose name is on the Deed to our property, told my husband we needed to have an attorney dispute some major discrepancies in our loan documents bordering on fraud charges in our loan documents. We have been under so much pressure trying to keep our business going & dealing with this mess.Between HOA issues & hardship ... can you help?

In the meantime the buyer backed out and we got a replacement buyer for the same dollar amount and I was told it was a trustee sale at the end of the month no one told they wo n't postpone the trustee sale to even consider the offer because it needs to be 100 % of the market value in order to stop the trustee sale.

6784,2015-05-14,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"Good morning, In XXXX I opened a checking and savings account with Bank of the West at the XXXX XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I went to the XXXX, IA branch at about XXXX and XXXX to close the accounts. I was given checks which I took to my new bank to deposit immediately. 

In XXXX XXXX I received a letter from Bank of the West stating that my checking account was overdrawn. On a Saturday in XXXX my fiance and I went to the XXXX branch which is closest to me to find out why I received this letter when my account had been closed in XXXX. I spoke w/ a teller who stated that she remembered that I had closed the account in XXXX ; the teller set me up w/ a personal banker. The personal banker said she would have to check with her manager to find out why it was n't closed and that they would cancel the {$74.00} in fees to return my balance to {$0.00}. I received a phone call a few days later stating that the account is now closed and that it was an error on their part. I believed the personal banker in regard to the account now being closed and did n't give it a second thought after that day. 
Fast forward to Monday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when I received a courtesy call from the XXXX XXXX XXXX branch stating that my account was overdrawn by {$74.00}. I stated that this was an ongoing issue and that I had closed the account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and that I received this same call in XXXX. I asked them to please resolve the issue once and for all. The employee who called me ( XXXX ) said she would speak with her supervisor to find out why this is happening. I decided that afternoon when I got off work that I should go to my local XXXX branch and find out why this is still happening. The teller remembered me from both XXXX when I had closed the account and from XXXX when she set me up with the personal banker. She went into the back to call the XXXX XXXX branch because she said that she could tell the account number originated there. She came back and told me that since the account originated there that the XXXX branch could n't do anything about it and that the XXXX XXXX branch would have to handle the issue. 
I waited until Wednesday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for a phone call from XXXX and never received one. I called the branch and explained the issue in brief and asked to speak with a manager but was told the manager was out for the day. I then asked to speak with XXXX whom they stated was out of the office but would call me back later. Later in the afternoon I received a call from XXXX stating that the issue has been resolved and her explanation was only that it was a "" computer glitch '' both times. I do n't believe that, because today I am still able to log into my online account for checking and savings ; I do see that they credited the checking account to get it back to a zero balance, however it is definitely not closed. 
I am aware that bank employees have quotas to meet and that closing an account counts against that quota, so this may be what is causing this issue. I also am unaware if they may be actually closing it then reopening it or what exactly. 
Could you please check into this? Do I need to contact the police to file an identity theft complaint? 
Thank you

6817,2015-05-25,Credit card,,Transaction issue,,"I have a Banana Republic Credit Card issued through Synchrony Bank. In XXXX I set up an automatic online payment from my bank account. This is my usual form of payment and I had no reason to believe there would be an issue. I chose to pay from my current bank account, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, though a debit card associated with this account. The payment I chose to pay would 've covered the entire balance of the credit card for that billing statement ; {$100.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX my payment was processed however it was drawn from a previous bank account of mine ( XXXX XXXX ). In XX/XX/XXXX I used that account for payment to this credit card, but since that time I have closed the account. Naturally, the payment was returned since the bank account is no longer in existence. On the same day, the same payment was processed through the proper account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. At this point, all should 've been well. Yes, there was a return payment from an invalid bank account, but there was also a valid payment made. However, lines got crossed and I was contacted by Synchrony and advised that my payment was returned and that I still owed {$100.00} to payoff my account. So, I promptly made a telephone payment with the Synchrony bank rep who advised me of the missing payment. I made this payment from XXXX XXXX Bank. This is where I made an error and should not have believed the Synchrony Bank representative without first checking my own bank account. Upon review of my bank account I realized I had been charged XXXX for the {$100.00} from the XXXX XXXX Account and that I was only credited once on the Banana Republic credit card. The fiasco then started. As I tried to explain this story over and over again with Synchrony Bank I experienced pushed back and lack of understanding from nearly every person I spoke with. I spend an hour on hold with several telephone represntativs and made multiple attempts at online chat sessions. I was finally advised that with my own time and money I would need to fax proof of the duplicate payments from my personal bank account. I immediately complied, and faxed the requested documents. I then followed up 3 days later and was advised all was being processed and that it should be resolve in an additional 4 days. When 7 days elapsed I telephoned Synchrony Bank again. This time I spent another hour on hold and with multiple representatives re-telling the story. After some commitment I was then routed to a supervisor who understood my situation but then the telephone line lost connection. Ultimately, after some attempts and an additional half an our I was finally put back in touch with this representative who claims that she has taken care of the situation. While she has refunded the late fee and interest fee I still am not receiving credit for the duplicate payment {$100.00}. It has been over 30 days since I first contacted and I 'm becoming very frustrated. Additionally, I received notification from Synchrony Bank in the form of a letter, stating that my credit with them has been suspended due to my erroneous payments! I fear this situation may be affecting my excellent credit rating and it was truly not my fault. I have spend several hours of time and resources to rectify this situation and I still find it to be unresolved. I am hopeful that some investigation from CFPB will help to conclude this issue and bring me back to whole. Thank you.

This debt was recently taken off of my husband 's report, but not mine. Thus, I am writing to get it removed from my credit report. The company stated this debt was a result of a foreclosure in XXXX Virginia. However, my research unveiled by calling the county clerk 's office of where the property was located ; they stated the bank bought back the property for what was owed on the mortgage, thus resulting in no debt. I reach out to the debt collector many times to give me more information about the debt they claim to have. They agreed they would provide me a breakout of the debt on numerous occasions, but they never did. Each time, I kept getting letter after letter, with no breakouts. They kept making empty promises, and they continued to harass my husband saying that we owe this debt. We received a notice from them stating this : "" As required by Section XXXX of the XXXX Virginia Code, ClearSpring Loan Services XXXX Inc. is required to notify you of the following information concerning the account referenced above : "" The law limits how long you can be sued on a debt. Because of the age of your debt, XXXX - XXXX MRT Deficiencies can not sue you for it and XXXX - XXXX MRT Deficiencies can not report it to any credit reporting agencies. '' Even after receiving this notice, they are still trying to collect this debt and it shows up on my credit report. My husband did everything we could do in terms of researching any debt and requesting the breakout of what this debt is for. I am writing because even though recently the debt was removed from my husband 's credit report, it is still on mine. I would like them to remove this debt, as there are huge question marks on the validity of this. Please help get them to remove this from my credit report.

In XXXX XXXXI was notified that we were XXXX payments behing on each loan. Immediately, we found our receipts and took them into our local branch to show the manager. Told her that when cash was paid at teller counter for these XXXX loans, the teller wrote and posted the wrong payment amounts to the accounts. Just reversed the payments. Easy enough to fix in my mind. Paid XX/XX/XXXX payment. Went to pay XX/XX/XXXX payment and they would not accept it saying that they had already sent loans to XXXX XXXX Attorney in XXXX, NC. 
Two week later our XX/XX/XXXX payment came back by a check from XXXX. 
XXXX of the loans would have been paid in full by XX/XX/XXXX, and the other had about 18 months left to pay. 
During this time we constantly made contact w/XXXX different locations and departmentstrying desperately to find someone who would step up and take some authority to help us. Payment slips were sent XXXX times to different people proving that we were NOT behind on payments. Finally in XXXX we found XXXX XXXX who confirmed over the phone that we were correct and up to date on our payments and apologized for all the trouble. She sent the accounts to a mortgage dept to get things set right and told us not to pay anything on either loan. Still as we continued to make contact with her, she said that they did n't rectify this problem and she could not understand what the delay was. I also want to put in here that XXXX did not document or record ANY of this communication. I did begin to take down dates and people 's names as I realized they were not noting all the communication that was made or what had transpired with each phone contact. By XX/XX/XXXX I could n't take the stress and loss of sleep from worrying over this, and from getting run around in circles for 6 months with this bank. My husband continued the fight and upon trying to get back with XXXX XXXX he were told she had resigned from the bank. Back to square one. 
Much contact transpired between XX/XX/XXXX and today with no help to set this situation right. 
We have contacted our State Attorney and then XXXX. XXXX told them that the payments were applied but will not take the fees accrued for their mistake so we can pay what is truly owed on these loans. We also have gotten our own lawyer at our own expense to help rectify XXXX mistake. 
In XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter stating that XXXX sold our loans on XX/XX/XXXX toSLS in XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX supposedly has no more to do with this problem. 
SLS is telling us we still owe back to XX/XX/XXXX and ALL the accrued late fees and attorney fees that this problem has caused. These fees were all accumulated because of XXXXXXXXaccounting errors and we are /now suppose to be responsible for them?? 
We have even tried to offer SLS a fair settle amount in a one-time, lump payment to handle this situation, but they act like they do n't even hear us. That is what we were hoping to be able to do because we are told by XX/XX/XXXX they will take our home. 
We have also tried to get them to let us begin to pay our loan as before without fees imposed on us by XXXX mistake, but they still do n't respond. 
We have been paying for this home for 15 years and have XXXX children and can not lose it due to an unreputable, and dishonest bank. Please help us!!!

XXXX of the accounts on my credit report that is n't mine is being reported by Enhanced Recovery Corporation. It is for an XXXX XXXX XXXX account. I disputed the account with the credit bureaus as not belonging to me because I currently have and have had XXXX XXXX XXXX for the last 7 years! I am a current client of theirs and do not owe them any money! Well I was shocked when the account came back as verified. 

When the account came back as verified, I called Enhanced Recovery to figure out how they were verifying the account. I spoke with a XXXX XXXX and asked for documentation on this supposed debt as well as an itemization of the supposed charges. I was told that "" media '' would be requested and I would be provided with an itemization of these charges. 33 days later I still have n't been provided with any documentation and now I ca n't even get a straight answer as to what is going on as I am being transferred from XXXX office to another since they claim they have XXXX offices. 

I am no expert on the law, but I have done research on this type of thing and from the Federal Trade Commission 's own link to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a collection agency has 30 days to provide validation of the debt or stop collecting the debt as it is not a legitimate debt. Enhanced Recovery has failed to validate this debt yet still refuse to remove it from my report. Furthermore, they ca n't even give me an excuse as to why they ca n't validate it or remove it. Actually, they do n't even talk to me much because they keep trying to transfer me to supposed supervisors who are always busy. They even went as far as to say they would give me the information to the president 's office and put me on hold for XXXX minutes before the line was disconnected. 

I may not have perfect credit, but I should not have to suffer illegal credit reporting for something that is not mine. I am a current customer of XXXX XXXX XXXX and have been for 7 years so how could I have a collection that XXXX XXXX XXXX themselves have not contacted me about? Enhanced Recovery is making my credit worse without proving that the debt is mine or even legitimate. Because they refuse to even talk to me, I am contacting you so you can investigate them as I am sure that I am not the only person they are doing this to. If I do not get a resolution on this I will be forced to sue them as I will not tolerate being treated like this. There are laws and just because they are collection agency does not mean they get to ignore the law.

7066,2015-07-12,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"I was referred to George Mason Mortgage and XXXX XXXX, NMLS # XXXX, by XXXX XXXX as a result of my interest in purchasing one of XXXX 's townhomes in XXXX XXXX, MD. I went to a presentation at the homesite where XXXX was giving a presentation on options available to 1st time homebuyers to obtain down payment assistance. At that time, he informed the group of a program where 1st time homebuyers with greater than {$25000.00} in student loan debt could get a loan with an interest rate of 2.75 fixed for 30yrs and XXXX down payment assistance. The program was a new initiative that had just come out the day before the presentation. I was very excited about the program because I had a great deal of student loan debt and would not have been able to purchase a home with payments I could afford otherwise. I made application the following day for the loan and was told by XXXX that I was the very person this program was made for and I met all the qualifications. I followed by putting a contract on a to be built home that would be completed around when my current lease would end which was in the XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX timeframe. I cooperated fully and provided all documentation requested in order to qualify for the program mortgage loan. I received a preapproval letter and good faith estimates that included the program funds and interest rate. I picked out all my preferences for the home at the builders design center and made a home choice based on the amount I was told by XXXX that I could afford. XXXX months later, I receive an email from the salesperson at the builders homesite, asking me to come to a meeting with her and XXXX regarding financing options because the money from the program I applied for was running out. It also said not to worry because my funds were secure but they wanted to have a back-up plan. I was confused and did n't understand why we needed a back up plan if my funds were secure. At the meeting I was told that the initial program did run out of funds and there was a new program but with a higher interest rate and only {$5000.00} in down payment assistance. I asked why should I have to take the XXXX program when I had already applied for the XXXX program. I was then told that I had to close on the home within XXXX days and my home would not be closed in the XXXX day window. I asked why was I not told about the closing timeframe so I could have made another choice and there was no explanation. I was told that there was a possibility that I could receive an extension on the closing date but that even the extension would not be able to extend to my closing date of XXXX. I made it clear that the only way I could afford to go through with the purchase on the home is if I received the terms of the original program because the alternate program would make my mortgage payment too high. I sensed that there was something I was not being told and called the state office that managed the program the following day. To my horror I was told that I was never submitted for the program by my loan officer. I called XXXX and told him that I was contacting the state program office to ask for an extension to which he responded, "" do n't do that ''! After telling him that I contacted them, he finally admitted that he neglected to submit me for the program with the excuse that it still would not have mattered since I was not closing within the XXXX day timeframe. I asked him again why he did not tell me this information up front and he had no real answer. I have requested that his company make this error right by buying down my interest rate to what it would have been in the initial program and provide the additional {$5000.00} in down payment assistance that was lost. He has been unwilling to correct this error that has cost me my only chance to purchase a home and I do not think this is right.

7070,2016-06-04,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account terms,"I attempted to get a merchant account through XXXX Quickbooks to allow my clients to pay me via ACH transfers. I had previously had a merchant account through XXXX called XXXX XXXX XXXX which had allowed me to receive these transfers but they discontinued it and asked people to pay to migrate over to Quickbooks. After a representative from XXXX submitted the merchant account application on my behalf, I received an email from XXXX saying that I was denied a merchant account because they 'd checked my credit score with the agency Experian, and my credit score had come up as a XXXX on a scale of XXXX to XXXX. I checked my credit score with Experian and it came up as a XXXX. I contacted XXXX and explained that there must be a problem because there is no such thing as a credit score of XXXX and that my Experian report said I had a score of XXXX. I asked them to resubmit the application and again received an email saying that I was denied because my credit score was XXXX. They said the XXXX was what Experian was reporting to XXXX and that I should contact Experian and have them fix the problem because it was on their end. XXXX would not accept me sending them my Experian credit report that showed my credit score as a XXXX. I contacted Experian and spoke with a representative in their credit dispute department. She told me there was nothing wrong in my credit report and that there was no such thing as a credit score of XXXX, and that furthermore, credit scores do not range from XXXX to XXXX as it states in XXXX 's denial email. They range from XXXX to XXXX, and that mine was a XXXX. She also said that it looked like XXXX pulled only a soft credit report on me that does n't include a credit score. She offered to contact XXXX with me on a XXXX call and we did that, speaking with someone named XXXX in XXXX 's underwriting department. The Experian representative explained the situation to XXXX at XXXX, explaining that there 's no such thing as a credit score of XXXX, that it did n't look like they 'd pulled a credit report with score for my case, and that my credit score was a XXXX. XXXX insisted that they do pull a credit score from Experian, and that Experian was reporting my credit score as a XXXX. At the end of the call, XXXX said she had spoken with a supervisor that they 'd be reviewing my case and that I 'd hear something back within a few days. I waited a week and had not heard anything back so I called XXXX and spoke with XXXX in their underwriting department. XXXX said that it is not true that XXXX gets back to you after reviewing the case, they make a final decision and do n't notify you. He also said that they did another pull from Experian and my credit score came up as a XXXX again. He said that the decision XXXX had made to deny my merchant account was final. I asked if I could see the credit report they 'd pulled and he refused saying that any information about the reasons for merchant account denial beyond credit score is proprietary and they do not give out that information. I would like to know why XXXX would give me false information about my credit score being a XXXX ( which does not exist ), would state falsely that credit scores range from XXXX to XXXX, and would deny me a merchant account to simply receive funds from clients ( I did not want to make any payments ) when in effect my credit score of XXXX is considered great. I 'd also like to know why they would n't accept me sending in my credit report, refused to give me a reason for denying me a merchant account and refused to help me in this matter. I am also concerned that there may be a problem with the way Experian is reporting my credit score to other agencies. I 've attached both denial emails from XXXX stating my credit score is a XXXX, and my credit report from Experian stating my credit score is XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian,WI,532XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-06-22,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1954459

My XXXX family home is in XXXX XXXX, and when Hurricane XXXX hit, I was a XXXX resident. I have since moved back into the home. I received no FEMA assistance, because I did not occupy the home. There was a foot of water in the house. Wells Fargo offered me XXXX six month payment moratoriums and promised to put the arrears on the back end of the loan, via a mortgage modification. Wells Fargo then sold the mortgage to XXXX in 2013 for a mortgage backed security issue, and the terms of the payment moratorium and mortgage modification changed. The new investor then demanded the full sum of the payments and my home is now in foreclosure. The investor will not give me a modification, after numerous attempts. The investor is uncooperative and has stringent modification terms, which are unattainable. There has to be a regulatory agency that can thwart this illegal act. Wells Fargo is culpable, the XXXX mortgage back security is culpable and I 'm now at the end of my rope, fighting to keep my home. I do not qualify for the XXXX Homeownership protection program because my income is $ XXXX above the maximum. I 've poured my blood, sweat and tears into my home.

I was in a domestically violent relationship with my co-signer who I was living with at the time of activation of this card until I moved out at the beginning of XXXX. I purchased my own car right before moving out, having to do this behind his back so I could get out of this abusive relationship. Once I moved into my house that I rent, in XXXX XXXX, I was now responsible for a car payment, house rent, cell phone, lights, gas, groceries ; things I was not having to purchase before because he controlled every aspect of my life against my will. He made statements that he would pay this credit card off, at the time he had his XXXX for 15 years and was very successful, I was a struggling college student trying to get into XXXX and working at $ XXXX. It became impossible for me to be able to keep up with the payments and intrest rate of 26 %. I was accepted into the XXXX in the XX/XX/XXXX. I had to get student loans, I was not eligible for financial aid, I was going throught emotional stress, my hours at work had been cut in half. it is impossible to pay off this debt especially when someone else was the main user of this credit card besides myself.

7201,2016-01-07,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"I opened a U.S. airways credit card about a year and a half ago. 

1. I never received my original card. I never activated my original card. I forgot I ordered the card because I never received it or activated it. 

2. I received an overdue bill for the credit card. I accrued a late payment charge because the card had an activation fee of around {$100.00} dollars, and thus started with a balance. 

3. Upon receiving the overdue account notice, I immediately called Customer Support, and told them I never received the card. I pay the orginal {$100.00} activation fee to clear the balance. They sent me out a replacement card, and I was assured that the late fee would be reversed. 

4. I receive my card in the mail in the mail and decide not to use it because of the poor experience. 

5. A few months later, I check my mail and find another late fee on the account. It turns out they never reversed the original late charge! I now realize, I have been racking up late payments for a credit card that I never even activated, and had spent {$100.00} out of pocket for the privilege. 

6. I call customer support for a second time I document the customer support call record this time : & lt ; NUMBER & gt ; They apologize profusely and tell me they 've successfully reversed the charges. I have her check the credit bureau to see if this dinged my credit history. She insisted that she talked to her team member and fixed my credit, by retracting their report. 

7. I check my old e-mail account and see ANOTER LATE PAYMENT e-mail buried in my inbox. This could have was from a 'Barclays card ' which, apparently, my old U.S. Airways card had magically turned into. 

8. I am livid, I escalate this request and reference the customer number, I am connected with a senior specialst and I stay on the line with her while she reverses is all of the charges. She is astounded when she finds out that these late payments were generated by an account balance of XXXX cents. How that XXXX cents got there, I have no idea, because I was told that all charges were reversed and there was a XXXX balance. She is angry that one of her customers has to deal with this, and is confused as to how or why the XXXX cents was in my account as I had a zero balance after the last horrible experience. 

9. The customer service agent reverses each charge one by one and closes my account. I think I 've finally resolved it. 
10. Now, months later, I check my e-mail and see ANOTHER LATE CHARGE NOTIFICATION FROM them. I have lost, time, money, and maybe even my credit score. 

11. This is my story. I posted this to the Consumer Protection Bureau and social media so the public may be aware of the abhorrent business practices.

7218,2016-03-27,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, Chase ( NMLS ID : XXXX ) Mortgage banker XXXX XXXX ( NMLS ID : XXXX ) approached me and offered me a loan with No point, No fee, XXXX ARM 3.375 % interest rate to refinance the mortgage loan on our investment property ( refer to the loan application form, the subject property address for the loan is my investment property ). She told me that a cash-out refinancing to a loan amount of {$410000.00} would be necessary in order to get the interest rate of 3.375 %. Since the deal offered by XXXX was better than what other loan brokers had offered me, I re-confirmed all the terms with XXXX again and decided to accept her offer. I then submitted my loan application, along with all the requested documentation, to Chase bank through XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. She emphasized that the rate and price could only be promised until Monday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. And I was also told the refinancing process would take about 45-60 days. So a mutual agreement about the rate and terms on the mortgage application has been established on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
After receiving the loan disclosures dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from Chase, we went in XXXX office to sign all documentation from the package on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. We did clearly question why the float rate option on Lock-in Agreement had been checked if the rate lock had previously been done. XXXX simply told us to ignore it. Moreover, we also pointed out there was an {$8800.00} fee charge listed on the GFE dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Again, XXXX simply told us to ignore it and do n't worry about it. She told us Chase bank will refund all the fees at closing since this is a NO Point, NO Fee refinance loan. 
The fact is XXXX did n't lock the rate for our loan on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. She locked the rate on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instead. From the GFE dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, there is also XXXX point fee charge against the original NO Point, NO Fee she offered to us. 
We, as Borrowers, had absolutely no idea why the rate lock was performed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On the other hand, our understanding was that the rate had been locked on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the loan documentations would be ready for signing by end of last XXXX. ( We had been told several times by XXXX while we checking the loan status with her during XXXX XXXX. ) After we received the GFE dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, we contacted XXXX XXXX and pointed out the discrepancy and the fees, and questioned her. Her answer is still the same : just ignore it and do n't worry about it. 
In XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX suddenly started to avoid responding to my inquiries about the loan status. I had to seek assistance from XXXX assistant, XXXX, and the Chase loan processor myself in order to keep the loan process going and hope the loan could be funded before the rate lock expired on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
Unfortunately, XXXX kept delaying the loan process and refused to make corrections to the extra fee charge, the loan was unable to be funded before XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and expired, which incurred an additional XXXX point of fee charge to the loan. 
During the entire loan application period, we, as Borrowers, have submitted the required documentation to Chase in time and never delayed anything along the loan process. We have kept all the email communication between XXXX and us to prove this point. The documentation requested from Mortgage Commitment Letter ( dated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) was submitted to XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
XXXX locked the rate on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and found out a fee charge of 2.5 %. According to XXXX, she reported to her Lending Manager, XXXX ( NMLS ID : XXXX ), immediately and requested to remove the fee charge. But nothing had been done by XXXX at all ; thus the loan was unable to get funded by rate lock expiration date on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, which further caused an extra 0.5 % fee charge to this loan. Chase bank side is fully responsible for this charge. 
As of today, there are total of XXXX points of fee charge on this loan.

They said they were going to sue me on a debt that has been removed from the credit report and is no longer valid. I received a phone call asking to speak to XXXX I told the guy on the phone that he was not there he just started telling me information that I needed to tell XXXX not verifying that I was his wife until after he gave me the information.

The check stated by signing and cashing I would enter into installment loan with them. At the time I was consolidating debt and needed the money and the low monthly payment of XXXX enticed me. I deposited the check and made XXXX payments before deciding to pay in full. I sent several emails through their online portal asking for final balance and never heard back. They called me XXXX time before I paid off the loan, telling me I can have an additional funding, I advised not interested but after this call from my local XXXX XXXX branch, my preference is to receive communication in writing for financial matters pertaining to this loan so I will not call them or discuss over the phone. This is based on the strong urging from the caller to visit them to receive "" more money. '' After this call I had a bad feeling about this loan. They have tried calling my desk phone at work but I will not answer since personal calls are not allowed and because I prefer in writing. My total payments were {$76.00} more than I borrowed and the final payment I sent was what appeared on my credit report as total now due ( this entry somehow has now disappeared from my credit report ). After it vanished from my report I figured it was paid in full only to receive another call to my work number this past Friday XX/XX/XXXX. I checked XXXX 's web portal this morning and it shows an open loan with a "" maturity '' date of XX/XX/XXXX and my next payment due as {$60.00} with a future date of XX/XX/XXXX. I have not received any billing statements nor have I signed any documents other than the unsolicited check they sent me. I suspect they are withholding the total due and future dating a payment for some interest charges to accrue interest. My loan was open less than XXXX months and by my calculations ( based on future date and total payments ) my total interest paid for a 60 day loan of {$1200.00} would be {$460.00}. I have never received any acknowledgement for the XXXX emails I sent, I do not wish to speak to this company other than in writing and they have never sent me a single statement in the mail. An online search of complaints shows similar experiences with other clients. Attached is supporting documentation showing the payments made from my XXXX XXXX checking account and the deposit of the {$1200.00} check back in XXXX into my XXXX XXXX account. I do not have any other documents since none were ever provided by this business. 
I strongly believe they are comitting predatory lending and fraud based on my above experience.

MY QUESTION TO XXXX FUNDING IS THIS : Why did you drag me into litigation when I invoked arbitration from day one? You ignored me. You denied my due process. 

CURRENT SITUATION : I was unlucky enough to get a superior court judge that does n't know arbitration laws and he gave XXXX a summary judgment against me. I fought the litigation as much as possible, but the irony is that the arbitration clause protected me from litigation and yet XXXX kept dragging me through it. 

Now there is a summary judgment that I am appealing to the Court of Appeals, who I hope knows the arbitration laws. 

WHY WAS I PUT THROUGH LITIGATION EVEN AFTER I INVOKED THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE? Why is it okay you ignore my rights as a consumer that is invoking the arbitration clause? I want answers. You have really ruined my health and denied my rights.

It is as clear as day how Equifax is not verifying any information when checking on disputes. The quick story is that I am a victim of ID theft. I had XXXX items blocked on my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Last month Equifax added these items back on. I immediately sent them the police report and ID theft report and even updated it. They ignored it and said they will NOT block them even with all the proper paperwork. This is just part XXXX. They then said they investigated each XXXX and verified they belonged to me. They then put Collection Account and Skip on each XXXX of them. So, instead of blocking them at my request and pursuant to the FCRA consumer rights which is MY right as a victim of ID theft, they did not, they claimed to follow up, then put them in notes as collection and skip ( which means I ran from these accounts and they cant find me ). This is as untrue as can be, they all know where I live including Equifax. BUT to really prove how the violated my rights, they also put collection and skip on a VALID account that is mine, that I used daily, that is in good standing. PLEASE see attached. They lied, they added Collection and Skip on all my accounts I asked to Block then EVEN DID ON VALID ACCOUNTS. Not only that, they show all of the collection and skip accounts as being paid on time. HOW? Just look at the attached. I can file a major lawsuit against them. They have accounts on time in collection and skip. They have a valid account listed as collection and skip. ALL of these accounts are showing as being paid on time. Every consumer right I have under FCRA is being violated. I simply had a total of XXXX items that I blocked and now it is XXXX items due to them adding stuff, lying and making up items on my report. Just look at the attachment it explains it all. It is as easy as pie to see how they are purposely trying to destroy me because I keep mailing them letters DAILY. They are upset at this and trying to hurt me and my credit. My credit is a XXXX but Equifax is trying to destroy it. They are evil people. They need to be held accountable, my attachment will show this all to you. I tried to put this all in XXXX document for you. I have amble proof, a police report, an id theft report but I do n't even need those, this shows clearly how every account is wrong.

The amount reported from the Reporter ( XXXX / XXXX was much higher then the agreed to amount between myself and XXXX collection agency. There was litigation then we settled out of court for XXXX but there has not been any notation that the payment was properly applied to my account. I see from the most recent credit report the XXXX settlement is being ignored and the XXXX payment is being placed against a much higher balance this balance is not what we agreed to and wrong. This was reported to the credit reporting agencies including XXXX on several occasions but they state an investigation occured. If this indeed happened there would be evidence I asked for this evidence. None was received by me. I believe that if those who place information onto a credit report pay a fee to do that that creates an conflict of interest when a subject of the report attempts to correct an inaccuracy. Disputes go as far back as XX/XX/2013 I have a copy of the NYXXXX XXXX Complaint. This company had more then enough time, it 's time to remove the item from the report.

7445,2015-08-23,Credit card,,Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,,"A few months ago, I received a voice message apparently was about my Barclay Credit Card. I returned their call to clarify the matter, but the person I talked to started to ask for my personal information including my SSN. Knowing that I do n't have any credit card with Barclay, I readily said that I am not giving any information about myself because I do n't have any credit card with Barclay and I have no intention of applying for XXXX. 
I continue to receive phone calls from them in which I did not pay attention for obvious reasons. Until I heard another voice mail that it was now under fraud investigation. Out of curiosity, I again returned their call. When I asked about the fraud investigation, the guy again started to ask for my personal information which I refused. I told him that I do n't have any credit card issued by Barclay and if there are applications under my name, they should not approved them. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a mail from certain XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 informing me that their investigation has concluded and the fraud claim has been denied. That, I will be responsible for the payment on the account as well as any applicable associated fees and finance charges. I immediately responded to XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015 informing them again that I did not apply for any Barclay cards and have no intention of applying for XXXX. That I will not be responsible for the payment of any account relating to any Barclay Cards for it is obviously fraudulent. 
When I was checking my credit score yesterday via XXXX XXXX, I was so upset to learn that I have a past due account with Barclay amounting to {$1700.00} which is now XXXX days late with XXXX missed payment and at 86.15 % credit utilization. Apparently, the account was open last XXXX XXXX, 2015 but was just recently reported to the credit bureaus. This account was only added to my credit report after my last update on XXXX XXXX, 2015. 
I immediately filed disputes to all XXXX credit bureaus about this account. This fraudulent transaction had significantly affected my current credit score. Thus, this complaint.

The XXXX mortgage holder, XXXX XXXX, is reporting on my credit report as "" settled '' in XXXX of XXXX, but the XXXX mortgage holder, Bank of America, is still reporting the XXXX mortgage as an "" unsettled '' account until XXXX of XXXX. 

History : In XXXX of XXXX, I contacted the Bank of America 's "" Charge Off '' Department, requesting that credit reporting error be corrected. After six weeks of telephone calls and emails, they told me on XXXX XXXX, XXXX there was nothing they could do. 

Then XX/XX/XXXX, I began receiving harassing calls from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, a law firm in XXXX, XXXX, informing me that they would be taking me to court to collect a {$45000.00} XXXX mortgage judgement against me on behalf of Bank of America. I informed them that this specific XXXX mortgage was settled in a foreclosure and therefore was exempt from collection. They stated that Bank of America considered this XXXX mortgage as a collectable debt. 

Finally, after months of harassing calls, mails and letters, I offered and Bank of America agreed to accept, a {$5000.00} payment to close this matter and on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I paid this amount. 

I am presently attempting to apply for a new home loan and I am unable to do so because Bank of America is reporting this account as last active in XXXX XXXX, instead of 2 years and 9 months ago ( XXXX of XXXX ) when it was foreclosed upon. Repeated calls to various departments at Bank of America have resulted in no response to my request. My wife and I would appreciate any assistance you can provide us.

7532,2015-12-09,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Information is not mine,"This is my XXXX dispute with this company regarding inaccurate information on my credit report that does not belong to me. This company has failed to produce any information whatsoever that proves these accounts are mine. Not only that, but they have/had multiple addresses on my file that do not belong to me. Therefore, the inaccurate information on my file may either be a mismatch of information with another consumer, or identity theft. I have disputed this information without success and my next letter to them will be an Intent to Sue. I have never disputed anything on my file previous to these disputes and I received a notice from Experian stating that without further documentation from either the creditor or the courts they will not reinvestigate. This is in violation of the FCRA and XXXX opinion agrees with me. Once I notify the bureaus that there is inaccurate information on my file, they must conduct a reinvestigation within 30 days and under section XXXX promply delete unverified information. Your response states that you will not reinvestigate specific accounts on my credit without an update from the court or the original creditor. This is a violation and the Congressional opinion from a lawsuit will prove this. I have notified you that these accounts are inaccurate on my credit and you must reinvestigate ; if you do not, you are in violation of sections XXXX ( a ), XXXX and XXXX of the FCRA, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( a ), XXXX and XXXX. XXXX ( a ) places the burden of investigation squarely on the consumer reporting agency and by stating that I must handle this myself with the original creditor, you are in violation of said statute. 
Be aware that once I state that no reasonable reinvestigation has taken place, I will also have a separate claim pursuant to XXXX XXXX a ). I am including a lawsuit, XXXX vs XXXX XXXX now Experian XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My lawsuit against your company will include violations of the same statutes, XXXX U.S.C. XXXX. A consumer reporting agency that negligently fails to comply with FCRA 's requirements is liable for actual damages, costs, and reasonable attorney 's fees. XXXX XXXX. XXXX. Willful noncompliance renders a consumer reporting agency additionally liable for punitive damages. XXXX XXXX. XXXX. You have shown negligence and willful noncompliance by failing to delete promptly inaccurate or unverifiable entries on my report. 
By stating that I must resolve the problem with the creditor or that without an update from the creditor or court, you are in clear violation of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a ) and XXXX ( b ). This position has been rejected by the United States Courts XXXX. Rather, the statute places the burden of investigation and reinvestigation squarely on the consumer reporting agency. 
Not only that, but I disputed a bankruptcy on my account that does not belong to me and it came back as verified, yet when I wrote to the court, they stated that they do NOT verify with the CRAs, therein making this account unverified and must be deleted.

My credit report is showing 90 days past due within the last 12 months, which is preventing me from refinancing my home ( which is what i 'm currently trying to do ) and also I can not receive my overpaid escrow money from 2014, and also it is loweriing my credit score every month.

I have sent in every document they have requested numerous times. As I am self-employed they have requested more and more documents and due to the inability to accept online documents, I have had to pay to have documents printed and reprinted, just so I can sign every page and then pay to have documents faxed to Wells Fargo. 
My financial situation became difficult when the economy crashed. Since I am XXXX I can not file for unemployment assistance. I had to use all our savings. Then my child became very ill and the last year was spent helping her become healthy, but the cost of the treatment, much of which was not covered due to being "" out of network '' for our XXXX XXXX plan was a further strain on my finances. During all this I was trying to get Wells Fargo requested documents even though the form states that no documentation was needed. I also requested information on what to do if the house is now "" under water '' as there is both a mortgage and a home equity line of credit and I believe the value of the house is now less than those XXXX loans. I have not been given any information on this. Now I am told again they need more documents but the person who can tell me what is needed has not responded to several emails and today is "" in a meeting ''. When I requested immediate assistance I was transferred to a "" manager '' but that went right to voice. I was told by Wells Fargo to stop making payments while this process went forward, now my house is in foreclosure. I offered to start making payments and even make a lump sum payment toward the past due balance, I was told they would not accept any payment. This is now impacting my health, my XXXX is unbelievable. I can not believe that Wells Fargo is allowed to buy up all the mortgages and then abuse homeowners in this manner. It is disgusting.

7681,2016-01-20,Mortgage,Other mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"Specialized Loan Serving ( SLS ), which is the most recent servicer of my loan has demanded payment from me for a number of years from me, regarding what appears to be somewhat of a phantom debt. This debt has been long disputed multiple times with multiple servicers with relation to the origination of my predatory loan. My loan which was conceived as a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) line of credit of {$70000.00}, with a rate of 9.5 % interest and placed me at great risk based upon complete disregard for my Tangible Net Benefit and ability to repay. At the time my loan was originated with XXXX, failed to protect my future financial interests and ultimately forced my loan into foreclosure as a result of ignoring basic underwriting guidelines as well as violations to The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) which prohibits unfair lending practices. Furthermore, there has been unfounded and incomplete evidence provided by SLS surrounding that the above mentioned loans origination, chain of title and assignments are unclear. 
SEE EXHIBIT "" A '' SLS INCOMPLETE QWR RESPONSE Due to the SLS, failed response to my issues, I 'm considering raising this matter in the Court as I feel it may be the proper venue for action under 28 U.S.C. Section 1391, because one or more of the Defendants maintains executive offices in or conducts business in the district relevant to where real estate is located in this concern. 
The interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending enumerates certain tactics that may indicate predatory lending. Nonprofit groups have also published widely accepted guidance on these kinds of practices that may constitute predatory lending. Predatory loans typically combine risky loan features, thereby placing the borrower at an excessive risk of default or foreclosure. 
For purposes of this Complaint, "" Combined-Risk Loans '' are loans that meet the definition of high-cost loan under HMDA. HMDA, which is an extension of The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act ( HOEPA ) and enacted in XXXX as an amendment to the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) to address abusive practices in refinancing and home-equity mortgage loans with high interest rates or high fees. Loans that meet HOEPA 's high-cost coverage tests are subject to special disclosure requirements and restrictions on loan terms, and borrowers in high-cost mortgages1 have enhanced remedies for violations of the law.

I authorized the money from the account to be transferred from my XXXX XXXX Account. After opening the account, I established and verified an external transfer with XXXX XXXX Checking. Since this date I have been accruing interest in the savings account but have not transferred additional money. On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I requested to transfer a portion of the funds to my XXXX account. I was informed that my account was on "" hold '' due to failure to verify the source of the deposit and no withdrawals could be made. I called customer service and spoke with a supervisor. She informed me that because I did not establish an external transfer relationship with the account where the funds were initially received, I could not have access to the funds at all. I also was informed that there was no other recourse since this bank operates completely online. She also refused to allow me to close this savings account and have the funds returned to the source without interest. I believe that I met the Terms & Conditions of the account service by establishing an external account relationship with the bank where the funds were initially transferred, which has the same routing number. I provided proof of identify when I authorized the initial transfer of funds from XXXX and Barclays inherently acknowledges that the funds came from an appropriate source by accepting the funds and providing interest on the account for the past five months. Barclays has not contacted me by phone or mail to inform me of any concern with my account and will not release the funds unless I verify the initial account through test deposits, which will take several days to accomplished. I am extremely concerned that Barclays has withdrawn money that I authorized, has had custody of my funds for five months, but now refuses to release these funds to me. According to the Terms & Conditions, this Dream Savings account does not require a minimum initial deposit and only requires a minimum amount for {$0.00} to be accured in interest each month. There is no reason why I should not have immediate access to my funds as an account holder and if there was a concern, the initial deposit should have been returned and the account closed after 5 business days.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Barclays PLC,GA,303XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-06-05,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1954842

I have applied for a loan modification which was approved. My loan payments were in the vincinity of XXXX per month and the modification bought it down to XXXX. I was very happy knowing that I was in the process of a divorce, severely limited in my finances and knew that the new payment would allow me to keep up to date on the mortgage. NO WHERE in the papers that were notarized and signed was a mention of any other amount other than the {$910.00}. I showed the papers to my divorce attorney, my close friends ... .everyone said that they only can see that TD Bank has approved XXXX. I sent the paperwork and waited for the check to clear for about a week. No check and no message from TD so I called and spoke to the person named on the form, XXXX XXXX. She told me that - no, my check was n't received, nor were the papers that were notarized and furthermore, my XXXX check was n't enough. My payment was actually higher - I do n't remember the exact amount but it was approximately {$1400.00}. When I complained and said the paperwork states a different amount she told me that there is escrow to be paid. I told her that no one told me the amount would be more and that there is a paragraph in their paperwork that states the amount of {$910.00} would be my monthly payment for the life of the loan. Her answer to me was that the amount was reduced from the original and I should be happy with that. What XXXX XXXX does n't realize is that {$500.00} more a month is not what I can pay. I called the following day and spoke to another rep, XXXX XXXX who was not only helpful but compassionate. He saw that the check was deposited and the paperwork received - the previous week. He looked through the paperwork and said he thought it was odd that I was told XXXX but the paperwork states XXXX. He told me to wait a week and possibly the correct info would be updated in their system. I called a week later and spoke to XXXX. She told me that the did see the higher amount and that all she can offer is for me to send a letter to the escrow department asked for the money to be spread out over a certain amount of months. I told her that first of all - no one contacted me from TD to tell me about this new amount and I am hesitant to sign anything further because this is fraudulent business practice. We get lured in with XXXX amount and then the next day ... oops, wrong amount ... it 's really higher. This is ridiculous! How can this bank do this to customers who are already in a vulnerable position and TD takes advantage knowing they are uninformed and worried about losing everything they own. And then to have their employees not have the answers to give to customers. I asked XXXX if this is their practice - to not disclose the correct amount and she told me she did n't know that answer. Somebody in TD has to be made accountable for misleading consumers in this way.

This is a response regarding a communication from Wells Fargo for the above referenced complaint. 

Wells Fargo is once again lying by stating that it has not been able to contact me. In fact, I spoke with their representative on XXXX occasions since filing the complaint and have been in constant contact with the single point of contact. In the conversation with their executive office representative, he indicated that he could do nothing but review documents from the modification. They refuse to do anything to address their years long refusal to refinance this XXXX mortgage and repeated attempt to force me into short selling my home even when the XXXX mortgage is current and the owner of that mortgage has no interest in foreclosure. 

Someone from CFPB needs to actually step in here as this has been going on now for over a year. I have yet to see the agency do anything more than pass complaints on to Wells Fargo. Where is the consumer protection here?

7767,2016-05-03,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Application, originator, mortgage broker",,"We signed a purchase agreement XX/XX/2016, on a condo at XXXX XXXX, SC. For a few reasons, we applied for a mortgage with Bank of America. Our closing date was XXXX XXXX with a 10-day extension. We were assured that we should have no problem closing by that date. Even though the Home Services Specialist ( HSS ) who handled the application knew we were buying a beachfront condo, he did not aggressively pursue approval of the Condo Review Board until the very end of the process when that matter should have been addressed at the outset. As our closing date approached, we, our realtor, and our real estate lawyer tried to get specific answers regarding approval from the Condo Board and hence the mortgage. The HSS set XXXX different closing dates, with the final one on XXXX/XXXX/2016. The HSS would not return calls or e-mails or would promise to make calls that never came. At one point, he could not explain the condo issue to our realtor. He asked for documents which we supplied 2 or 3 times. Overall, he acted in an unprofessional fashion. Finally, on XXXX/XXXX/2016, our realtor forwarded an e-mail she received from the HSS telling her that the Condo Review Board had not approved the condo. As of XXXX/XXXX/2016, we have still not been informed verbally or in writing by the HSS or BOA that the mortgage was denied. Had the HSS and BOA been straightforward with us, we could have gone to another bank and probably closed the loan on time. We stayed in the process because the HSS gave us every indication that the mortgage ultimately would be approved. We and our realtor complained to the HSS 's supervisor only to have our phone and e-mail messages not returned. Because of the incompetence of the HSS, we nearly lost the condo.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Bank of America,NY,120XX,,Consent provided,Web,2016-05-03,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1907579

Once XXXX XXXX received the car back five or six months later, I did not hear anything else from them until now. They apparently filed for a judgement XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I was still at the XXXX address they have on file until XXXX, XXXX. They are garnishing my payroll check and I did n't even have the opportunity to show up for court to dispute or confirm the debt. It is now about 13 years later and I have to hear that they are garnishing my check from my employer after I called to find out what it was that was coming out of my check. My job sent me a copy of the order and was surprised that I did n't get anything about it. The order that they have states that I owe {$9600.00}. Small claims court only goes up to a maximum of {$6000.00}, so how is it possible to be sued for this amount? The original amount of the car was for {$10000.00} after finance charges. In XXXX, according to the documents they were only suing for {$5500.00}, which was the amount after the payments that were made before they received the car back and whatever they got when the car was sold or if they sold it at auction. According to their documents they have sent a sheriff or a bailiff to give me the information but I never received anything. At least, this is what was checked on the court paperwork. The address that was on the car loan I lived there until XX/XX/XXXX and there was a forwarding address given each time I moved except in XX/XX/XXXX when my family and I became homeless. We migrated to Washington State where I fell ill and was hospitalized for a couple of months and off and on throughout the years but we have been here for almost six years now. In XX/XX/XXXX, this debt also fell off of my credit report since it had been seven years and nowhere on it stated before that there had been a judgement from XX/XX/XXXX filed or awarded as judgments are part of public record or I would have responded. I would also have not just ignored a court order that I supposed to have received on several occasions. I have paperwork that I have obtained from the courts as well as what my job sent me. According to the information on XXXX XXXX, XXXX or before the claim was filed, they sent information to my job to obtain my current address as well as employment information. On this paperwork it states that I was supposed to be in court XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Again, I never received any information. They sent mail to my place of employment but I still receive no information by sheriff or certified mail from them to even give me a chance even after the judgement to give me a chance to dispute it or let me know that it had been awarded. Even in XX/XX/XXXX they had another address but in XX/XX/XXXX they still sent info the first address that they had on file according to the paperwork. I have the information that sent to my job and the information that was sent from the courts. I think this was unfair collection tactics on the part of the company. As I had been in the state of Indiana up until XXXX XXXX and there were plenty of opportunities to get in contact with me either by regular mail or certified mail. The post office had forwarding information on file as it is good for 12 months. The post office was always given an updated forwarding address each time I moved. If they were able to obtain current employment information why were n't they able to obtain my current address to inform me of this debt. My credit report even had up to date address information on file that they could have gotten my address from. Is there anything that I can do about this?

I unfortunately had to request a short sale as the modification payment coupled with loss of income made it necessary to sell our home. I received an offer on our home in XXXX of 2015 for $ XXXX, and it was submitted to the bank. Then we received notice that we had to sell via an online bidding with Nationstar. The bidding pricing range was $ XXXX to $ XXXX This occurred on XXXX/XXXX/2015. This process was supposed to have been done to expedite and ensure the home was sold at market value. Another reason we did not get as much traffic was because a lot of buyers did not want to pay for the 5 % buyers premium added to the purchase price. So in XXXX a bid offer was accepted bumping the offer we received in XXXX. Per XXXX guidelines we are supposed to have been given a reply within 30 days. We are now in XXXX and we are still waiting for approval. It has been about 2 1/2 weeks now that we have been waiting for PMI approval. How does this make sense to have the bidding to expedite the process and we are still waiting for an approval. From what I also understand, we should have received a Short Sale Notice, but we have not. I also have people coming to the house saying we are going into foreclosure sale because the foreclosure sale notice is published. This is very stressful and this is why with these lengthy processes and delays we lose buyers or as a homeowner we are mortified by the looming prospect of having our home foreclosed. Again, if the original offer was within the range, why did n't the bank just accept instead of accepting a higher bid, and then having to lower it? With such a long delay, it also makes it difficult to search for a new home to rent because we ca n't really commit and leave the home vacant. All of these situations make it for a very stressful way to live which also causes health concerns. Please assist us in expediting the process so that we may have a dignified closing.

7919,2015-10-28,Bank account or service,Other bank product/service,"Making/receiving payments, sending money",,"This is a growing problem with electronic bill payment through banks and credit cardcompanies. In the past, the representation was/is that an electronic payment started on a particular day would reach and be credited by the payee the next day. The electronic process is quick ; that it might take a day arises from the fact that payer must send, then payee must examine the "" package '', i.e. XXXX separate electronic processes : sending is completed the day of sending, examination of package by payee is done the same day or the next day. Thus, sending should be complete on the day of payment, crediting should be done either that same day if payee is entitled to use the funds that day or by the next day if entitled to use them the next day. There is no reason for further delay, and banks accepting electronic payments must do so promptly. Recently, I have been charged latefees and interest by XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX credit cards when evidence likely shows the sending was electronically done well before the due date, i.e. these credit card companies insist on crediting the day after so their computers can charge hefty late fees and interest. Meanwhile, the sending bank ( Citibank bill payment ) is now changing, without warning, its description of electronic bill payment to the effect that electronic payment will take 2 business days beyond the day of sending ( i.e. not counting the day of electronic sending ). This is not only unreasonable but collusion with other banks delaying crediting to charge late fees and interest. It is unreasonable because : Question & gt ; What is the sending bank doing on the day of sending electronically [ Note, these are recurringmonthly payments, so the bank knows weeks in advance when to start ] if not sending an electronic package which arrives somewhere the same day? It should not take 2 extra business days for the receiving bank to examine the electronic package electronically. The one extra day allowed in the past is more than enough, and receiving banks should credit payment either the day of actual electronic receipt or actual availability of electronic funds which is the same day anyway [ just like a check is supposed to have sufficient funds when issued, an electronic payment should have sufficient funds also ]. The problems arose with electronic payments scheduled for a Friday with a credit carddue date of Monday, with receiving bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX credit cards ) crediting payment and charging late fee and interest on Tuesday. When informed of this development, Citibank now changes its representation that it would not be liable until 2 business days after, i.e. not counting the day of sending, this is collusion with the receiving banks. An electronic transaction started on Friday should not take til Tuesday. A receiving bank knows THE SUM TOTAL of the package on Friday and can use those funds on Friday even before it distributes fund into each separate account. There is no reason why it should not credit the separate accounts by Monday, even retroactively if necessary. Whereas Citibank was previously willing to inform the receiving banks that the electronic payment was started on Friday, now it says it has no duty to help for any due date until ( i.e. falling before ) Wednesday.

We declined this proposal and continued to ask for a more affordable approach to keep our home. We feel that First Republic Bank did not look at our situation after we submitted our income and expenses again with an accurate picture as to what we could afford. Their solution was to have us resume the new monthly payment of {$3400.00}, which we still can not afford. The Manager of Special Assets, in a phone conversation with myself stated that we can not afford our home, so we should sell it. After much back and forth, First Republic Bank is refusing, we feel, to make any attempt to give us an opportunity to remedy our situation.

After contacting Enhanced Recovery several times, as well as XXXX, I found out that the account holder is another man with the same name as mine ( which is a "" common '' name according to an Enhanced Recovery representative ), but he has a different address ( his address is in Texas and I have lived in NC all my life ) and a different date of birth. In addition, the XXXX representative told me that there is not a social security number associated with the debt. I sent a certified letter to Enhanced Recovery saying that this was not my debt and they were contacting the wrong person. Thus, I thought this problem was resolved a few weeks ago, but now I see that Enhanced Recovery has submitted a complaint on my credit report. I do not know how this is possible if the date of birth for the account holder is different and they have no social security number. So to be clear, it does not seem like anyone has stolen my identity. Rather, Enhanced Recovery has limited ( and erroneous ) identity information on this debt and yet still continues to try to collect this debt from me. There are no other problems on my otherwise stellar credit history. This complaint from Enhanced Recovery on my credit dropped my score from over XXXX to XXXX.

8089,2015-08-29,Prepaid card,Mobile wallet,Fraud or scam,,"I 've had {$4600.00} taken from me with nothing but evasive responses from PayPal for a good part of a year. This has continued ever since they suddenly locked my account on XXXX XXXX of 2015. XXXX days later, I requested a refund for {$3000.00}. What followed has been a draining, unending experience. {$3000.00} was frozen in my PayPal XXXX card, which was unrelated to my PayPal account. The additional {$1600.00} is locked in my and my husband 's frozen PayPal accounts. 

On XXXX XXXX, PayPal promised they would send a check within XXXX business days, giving the following message : "" Your PayPal My Cash Card refund request has been successfully processed. You will receive your check by mail on or before the next XXXX days. '' The ticket # was XXXX. I waited over a month, but no check arrived. 

On XXXX XXXX, I called their customer service hotline ( XXXX ) and discussed my situation with CSR XXXX. She finally admitted that they knew they never sent the check to me, but they also never tried to contact me regarding a need of additional paperwork. She requested my ID, copies of my PayPal XXXX cards, and all receipts tied to the card to be sent via email or fax to XXXXXXXXXXXX or ( XXXX : XXXX ) with the subject of 'PAYPAL INACTIVE CARDS '. I emailed them with all requested information on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and verified that they received all required personal information. After that, three weeks passed without any response regarding the refund from PayPal. They were supposed to send the check within two weeks. 

So on XXXX XXXX, I contacted a CSR by the name of XXXX from the compliance department and requested an internal investigation into the refund process. She checked the status of the process but reported that the compliance department had n't processed the refund since before XXXX XXXX, the day I sent the personal information. She promised to send an email to the compliance department regarding the expedited process. 

I waited again until XXXX XXXX, 2015 and spoke with a supervisor by the name of XXXX and requested a check on the status of the refund, and he said that XXXX never sent an email to the compliance department, or the compliance department never processed my request. The supervisor XXXX promised me a refund within XXXX business days, but neither response nor refund at the time of writing this ( more than XXXX days ). 

Every time I have called PayPal, they have put me on hold for at least XXXX minutes. PayPal has kept over {$3000.00} of my money since XXXX XXXX, over XXXX days. Unacceptable. This reeks of fraud and scam. This is beyond reproach for such a large business. Never before have I dealt with such incompetence that it seems only plausible that they are manipulating customers for gain. PayPal conducts itself unprofessionally and arrogantly regards itself as above the law. 

My money is losing value due to inflation and lost interest rate. In addition to the {$3000.00}, they also have frozen {$110.00} in my account plus an additional {$1500.00} in my husband 's account for XXXX days. They have caused undue financial hardship to our family. This has been a horrible experience I would not wish on anybody. 

I am requesting a full refund ASAP. I would also like compensation for emotional stress, the many hours spent calling and waiting on hold, losses due to inflation and missed interest accrual, and I would like a written apology.

I have perfect feedback on both sites and many many returning thrilled customers, dedicating my life to making my customers happy. In XXXX after a customer in XXXX had apparently used a stolen credit card for an item they purchased in my XXXX XXXX and then subsequently filed a 'chargeback ' ( to which I immediately gave my okay for the funds to be returned to the rightful credit card holder, even though I believe this customer was using this stolen- or not stolen- card to defraud/steal from me ), I had my Paypal account 'Reviewed '. During this review period Ebay also closed my store because of their rule that all sellers must have a Paypal account in good standing and Paypal is the only method of payment sellers are allowed to use. After about 2-3 weeks of worry, phone calls and much travail I received an email from Paypal stating that they had decided to reinstate my account but that they would now withhold 25 % of all of my incoming funds for a period of 4 months ( a 'rolling reserve ' ) starting immediately ( no warning whatsoever ). They said this is due to a number of reasons, XXXX of which being that my credit score was below XXXX etc., etc. and that I had a high percentage of chargebacks ( I believe I have had less than XXXX in the last 12 months- XXXX of which were no fault of mine whatsoever ), blah blah blah. They are now holding about {$3000.00} of my money as of the date of this writing, and Paypal in the email ( see attachment ) also stated that I am not even allowed to ask them to re-review my account until after XXXX XXXX 2015. I would like Paypal to release my funds immediately, for XXXX thing because they are a Money Transmitter, NOT a bank, and as such should not be legally allowed to withhold money for the length of 4 months, regardless of whether or not it says this is okay somewhere in their giant and ever changing user agreement that they make all users sign, also because this has caused me to now have trouble filling my orders and paying my bills and will ultimately ( and possibly very soon unless I 'm able to get a loan ) make it impossible to stay afloat. Please help. There are also many others out there like myself, I am by far not the only XXXX. Paypal should be stopped from being able to abuse their power anytime they feel like it- at best it 's extremely unfair and at worst, it 's illegal. 
Thank you so much for any help. 
NOTE : I had to choose only XXXX option below, but really it should be both domestic AND international money transfers, as my funds being held are from both types of transfers.

In XXXX of 2013 I decided to try XXXX XXXX for a XXXX month trial period. I paid, use their service ( while still keeping my account with XXXX XXXX open ) and found I did n't like it at all. I closed this account, paid what was a small bill since I paid the other bills beforehand. Remember, I never closed my account with XXXX so I never had to reopen this account. I told them to come and pick up their equipment. Never happened! Since I paid the last of the bill I owed, I assumed this was it. They said they would send someone out to pick up the equipment, and that never happened! Then I called again and they said they would send boxes to me to send their equipment back to them and it never happened! Just trying to tell you what type of company I was dealing with. I have worked hard at getting my credit reports clean and paying all bills on time and mind you, never making the minimum payment. As you can see if you check my reports. Everything is paid on time if not before time. I found this on my credit report last year! Was shocked to see a {$67.00} bill on there from them since I paid the last of their bills many, many months ago! I have tried to no avail to get this removed from my reports. Calling XXXX, sending them emails, etc. I have also disputed this many, many times with the credit reporting agencies to no avail. I finally gave up and paid a bill that I DID NOT owe. I just wanted it removed from my reports since I have worked so hard to get where I am. ( all of their equipment : my wife, who broke her back before this, had to track through the mall with all of this heavy equipment to drop it off at a XXXX store. ) I do n't know where to turn. I just want justice. I ca n't seem to get anywhere with XXXX. I see many of these complaints! I just want this removed from my credit reports. They 've had all of their money ( plus more ) for quite some time now. There is no reason to do this to innocent people. I have been a customer of XXXX for many, many years and have never had a problem with billing. Please help me remove this from my credit reports. I feel I 'm being targeted because I did n't like their service. I get numerous advertisements in the mail from them to this day. If I had done what they accuse me of, I do n't think they would want me as a customer. If you need anything, please let me know. I have photos from my reports. I do n't care if I have prime credit cards, it 's the principal. They are just making me look bad in the eyes of creditors. This seems very unfair. Not good business practice. Thank you for trying to help the XXXX time, as a result, XXXX has removed this but Experian and XXXX have not. I have other screen shots but I 'm not sure I can upload anymore than XXXX. Please let me know if you need any additional ones.

The last month has been simply amazing. I took my children out for family dinner night..we decided to go to bbq XXXX for dinner. We 're laughing, eating, talking having a great time out the weather is a nice night considering it was XXXX. The waitress came to our table and asked would there be anything else we would like. My kids and. I were quite full. So we asked for you the bill. It was {$120.00} I gave her my rush card a moment later she said it was declined. Could n't be I asked her to please try it again. My kids looking at me. I 'm feeling a little concerned my self now. As she came back to our table again she said I 'm sorry XXXX . It 's declined. Now of all times this restaurant is crowded. What in the world I 'm going to do. I have no money on me my rush card is all I have. Finally I had to leave my kids at the table and go talk to the manager. Feeling embarrassed and nervous I had to tell the manager there seems to be a problem with my rush card. The manager told me he was going to have to call the cops and that we would be going to jail. What I try to explain .tried to call rush no one was available to help me. I was on hold for XXXX HOUR JUST TO HEAR THEY WERE HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH THE CARDS AND THEY WORKING ON IT. TO AVOID GETTING THE COPS INVOLVED I HAD TO GIVE UP MY CELLPHONE IN ORDER FOR US TO LEAVE and come back to pick it up when I got the money.

I called rush from Wednesday XXXX XXXX - XXXX all they could say was they apologize for the inconvenience. They working on it.

8218,2016-06-06,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My wife and I obtained a mortgage from Nationstar Mortgage last year when we purchased our home. Our account was impounded, which means our property taxes and insurance were included in the monthly payment. A few months after we obtained the mortgage, Nationstar sent me a check for approximately {$2500.00}. When I called to inquire about the check, I was told by a representative of Nationstar that it was a refund for a surplus in our escrow account. They also adjusted my monthly payment from approximately {$2400.00} per month to {$2000.00} per month. I told the representative that I believed there was a mistake, because when we obtained the loan we were told by the mortgage banker that the total monthly payment would be approximately {$2400.00} per month, which included taxes and insurance. The Nationstar representative assured me everything was fine, so I continued to pay the monthly amount of {$2000.00} that Nationstar billed me every month. 
This year, our tax preparer noticed that the property taxes we paid in XXXX seemed low, and suggested we look into it, as he believed we were n't paying the correct amount. My wife contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Office, who confirmed that we were delinquent on our property taxes, in the amount of {$6700.00}, which included fees and penalties in the amount of {$630.00}. We never received any statements from XXXX XXXX, who stated that they mailed all the notices to our previous address. However, they did notify Nationstar Mortgage in writing. Nationstar never made the payments, nor did they notify us about the delinquent tax amounts. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Nationstar Mortgage paid the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 's Office the total balance due of {$6700.00}, including the fees and penalties. They in turn, will pass those fees and penalties on to us. Our complaint is, if Nationstar made the mistake of not collecting and paying the correct property tax amount, and they were notified by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Office, why should we be responsible for the fees and penalties? 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we contacted Nationstar Mortgage and spoke with a representative XXXX XXXX XXXX and his supervisor ( XXXX XXXX, from the Escrow Account Department. We explained the situation, and the mistakes Nationstar Mortgage made, and explained that we did not believe it was our responsibility to pay those fees and penalties. The supervisor disagreed, and said he could not help us.

8234,2016-04-01,Credit card,,Billing statement,,"I responded to an offer made by my bank, Fifth Third Bank, to give me a limited time, interest-free credit card if I transferred my balance from another credit card company to theirs. I accepted the offer and transferred an existing balance from another credit card company. I did not received a bill from Fifth Third Bank for 2 months until I received a bill for 2 overdue payments and penalties. I finally sorted out this problem and got the penalties removed although the bank said that they had sent me the bills which I am absolutely certain I never received. 

The main source of my complaint against Fifth Third is that I have received a bill since I spoke to the bank which did not have any information for a 3 year payoff. I called the bank and could not get past an uncooperative customer service agent. I requested the amount I would owe if I chose the 3 year option, and the agent said that she knew of no such option and that she did not have the ability to calculate the lower payoff amount. I told her that the law required Fifth Third credit card bills to list the 3 year payoff option, and she denied that this was true. After a lengthy session of wait times and her reporting that her supervisor had said that they knew nothing of this option, I gave up. I have since received another bill without the 3 year option listed. I researched the 2009 Credit Card Act and found that banks ARE required to disclose this amount on their bills. I am willing to send copies of the XXXX bills in question but lack a scanner to process them. I hope that Fifth Third Bank is fined the maximum amount allowable for violations under the Credit Card Act.

During the underwriting process we were informed that we had late payments on the Wells Fargo Mortgage, which was surprising to me being that on more the one occasion I was told by Wells Fargo Representatives that late were not going to be reported. Our builders and Loan representatives insured us if Wells Fargo would remove the late payments we could continue our process and close as scheduled. 


I faxed a letter to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX requesting forgiveness and removal of all rolling late payments from my credit reports XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. This letter explained the reason for late payments due to transfer and move cross country as well as extensive renovations per request from property manager for Rental of property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This letter also explained that I had constant communication with Wells Fargo and was advised that these payments were not going to be reported as late. 

I called Wells Fargo on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and verified that the letter was received. I spoke with a representative by the name of XXXX XXXX. He advised me that my request would be forwarded to department that handles these request. I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX, with a message stating she would be working on my request. I returned the phone call left message with XXXX and spoke with another Representative that assured me that XXXX would be calling back. I spoke with XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and she informed me that she would be calling me back in 5 business days with final results of my request. I did not receive a phone call back so I called XXXX back. When I spoke to her she stated Wells Fargo would have an answer for me on or before XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I continued with walk through in new home with the expectations that this matter would be resolved on XX/XX/XXXX as stated. I took time off work so that I could be available for walk through and get information to loan officer so we could proceed with closing. I called Wells Fargo and they did n't have an answer and stated. When I called wells Fargo they informed me that that matter was not resolved, however they would resolve this issue by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I was very upset and asked to speak with a Supervisor and I did. This gentleman was very rude and did not hear my concerns at all even though I took my time and explained what was happening.

There is no way for a customer to access their escrow account or see any escrow activity. I now have received a tax bill for {$4300.00}. FBN should pay this from my escrow account. I called and they explained it was never set up, that they will do this. I faxed them all the documentation and they told me they would set it up, pay and follow up with me. 8 days later, no follow up. I call FNB again. They explain they can not find my paperwork - to please resend. It is just very frustrating because I, as a customer, have no way to view my account and see what is going in and what is being paid out. I will resend them the documentation again and call again to see if anyone has it and will pay it. Please require First National Bank to make customers ' escrow account activity available online. Thank you.

I told this to the ABM, and he said that I should not rely on my alerts as truth. I then told him then why even have that as an option, if it is n't correct. He could n't answer that. I told him I wanted to speak with his Regional Manager. He left her a message. She called me back yesterday, and although she is "" sympathetic, '' she will not refund any fees. She said that I had been allotted enough fee waivers, and even though it was their fault with not properly posting the real debit on their end, there would be no fee waiver.

8425,2015-09-16,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),Credit decision / Underwriting,,"The lender ( Lender ) changed my loan rate and charge ( points ) in a deceitful manner and in violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ). 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I spoke on the phone with a Mortgage Loan Officer, XXXX, ( Officer ) of Lender and I was offered a rate of 2.75 % with XXXX points for a XXXX ARM mortgage on a home for which the Agreement of Sale was already signed. I affirmatively refused that offer. The next morning, the Officer called me and offered me a mortgage rate of 2.625 % with XXXX points for the same home which I accepted and proceeded to lock in that rate. At no point during either of those conversations, or any other that I had with the Officer before then or since, did the Officer ask if the home was regarded as a condominium, nor did he inform me that condominium homes may elicit a different rate, nor did he inform me more generally that there are circumstances which may alter the locked rate. Had I been informed of such a possibility, I would have inquired further or declined the offer altogether. 

On XXXX XXXX, Lender completed a Good Faith Estimate which provided that "" [ t ] he credit or charge for the interest rate of 2.625 % is included in 'Our origination change, ' '' totaling {$1100.00}. Additionally, my Uniform Residential Loan Application, dated XXXX/XXXX/2015, provides XXXX in the Discount field of Part VII, Section h. 

On XXXX XXXX, Lender mailed me a copy of the appraisal report, which Lender had ordered previously. The appraisal report makes it very clear that the home is a condominium. 

On XXXX XXXX, five business days after Lender mailed me the appraisal report, Lender further mailed me a Mortgage Loan Commitment which states in Section XXXX. "" You have locked the interest rate. Your loan has been approved at a locked interest rate of 2.625 % and discount points of 0.000 % or {$0.00}. "" On XXXX XXXX, Lender mailed an amended Good Faith Estimate which now indicated that I "" pay a charge of {$1400.00} for this interest rate of 2.625 %. '' I received this amended Good Faith Estimate on XXXX XXXX, one business day prior to the date of settlement of XXXX XXXX, 2015. Lender mailed the amended Good Faith Estimate eight business days after Lender mailed the appraisal report and three business days after confirming the agreed-upon rate of 2.625 % with no points through the Mortgage Loan Commitment. 

On XXXX XXXX, I spoke with and emailed several various agents of Lender, including Officer, in an attempt to understand this additional fee and I informed the agents of Lender that I would never have agreed to the loan had I been informed that such a fee was a possibility. I was informed by Lender 's agents that in order to close on our contractually-scheduled settlement date of XXXX XXXX, 2015, I would be required to pay the additional fee. In order to avoid a lawsuit for breach of contract by the sellers of the home, I informed the agents of the Lender that I would proceed with the closing as scheduled, but would dispute the additional fee. 

At settlement, upon reviewing the documents provided, I noticed that the original included Uniform Residential Loan Application had been amended to indicate an amount of XXXX in Part VII, Section h. However, Part X states that "" [ t ] his information was provided : In a telephone interview XXXX/XXXX/2015, which is entirely incorrect. 

In addition to likely being intentionally deceitful and delayed, I contend that the actions of Lender, in particular the amended Good Faith Estimate, violated Sections 3500.7 XXXX e ) ( 1 ) ( ii XXXX ; XXXX iii ) ; ( f ) ( 1 ) ; and ( f ) ( 2 XXXX. By not mailing the amended Good Faith Estimate until XXXX XXXX, at least eight days after Lender received information sufficient to establish changed circumstances, Lender made it impossible for me to comply with my contractual obligations to the sellers to settle and investigate the additional fee and my other options.

My wife was and still is currently caring for her mother which is suffering from XXXX, which involves weekly XXXX as well as our son which was XXXX at the age of XXXX. My wife was in the middle of negotiations with OLS, before, during and after the sale of my home occurred. The timeline leading to the sale of my home on XXXX XXXX, 2015 are as follows : My wife received a call from OLS, agent on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2015 demanding payment on the mortgage loan in question. She emphatically advised the agent that we desired to keep the property and save our home, particularly due to the medical conditions of our family members as well as positive equity in the home at that time. She attempted to offer a payment over the phone and was advised that certified funds is required and was given XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) money wire information. My wife promptly made payment via XXXX, the very next day on XXXX XXXX, 2015. ( See Exhibit A-Western Union Payment Receipt ) Apparently, OLS rejected the payment without notifying me of any such action. This is XXXX of many deceptive actions that were perpetrated against my family before and during the execution of sale of our home. Misleading my wife 's efforts to make amends in catching up on our loan modification payments. We were made to believe that OLS, was in fact on outside and working with us to overcome our delinquency.We did not find out about our payment being rejected until my wife received a letter via regular mail from XXXX at XX/XX/XXXX, which was dated XXXX XXXX, 2015. ( See Exhibit B- XXXX XXXX notice of rejected payment ) My wife immediately contacted OLS on XXXX XXXX, 2015 about the rejected payment and was advised she needed to apply for a loan modification. At no point did the agent advise my wife of any action such as referral to the law office of XXXX XXXX. After completing a financial interview with her over the phone, the agent allegedly generated a modification package to be sent and an appointment was set to speak with a relationship XXXX named ( XXXX XXXX ) for XXXX XXXX, 2015. The day of the conference call was received by XXXX, my wife expressed that the package had just been received the day before on XXXX XXXX, 2015. XXXX apologized for the delay and again for the rejected XXXX payment from XX/XX/XXXX and assured my wife that there would be no sale attempts made to the property and all activity was on hold due to the initiated review and the fact that there was an assigned single point of contact ( SPOC ). In fact, XXXX went as far as completing another over the phone interview with my wife as done by the previous agent on XXXX XXXX, 2015. She asked when she could gather and fax the required documents to support the information given over the phone. She advised the agent that she would have the documents faxed no later than XXXX XXXX, 2015. XXXX again assured my wife that all was well and that she need not worry of any threats to the subject property and set up a new conference call for XXXX XXXX, 2015, making no mention of potential sale date pending for XXXX XXXX, 2015, further desensitizing my wife to any threat of foreclosure, which is deceptive and misleading, fraud to strip away all positive equity in our home. ( See Exhibit C- XXXX XXXX Electronically Completed RMA Dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 created by OLS internal System ) After our home was sold on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX called as planned on XXXX XXXX, 2015, to say the home was sold and nothing could be done any longer. Also that we would have to deal with the Real Estate owned department from now on.

Suntrust had never said that I would need to cover any closing cost in fact they have always said those costs would be rolled into the refinance. With the banks closing at XXXX for the weekend there was no way to even get a check if I had wanted to. In addition to that the notary made mention that my wife would need to be at signing. I have n't been married for 12 years and in fact Suntrust had requested a copy of my divorce decree which I provided, two months prior. In the mean time another week slips by as I wait for this "" simple refinance '' to be completed.

I have for the last 25+ years had my taxes escrowed and received the check XX/XX/XXXX to pay them before XX/XX/XXXX. At XXXX time I contacted Loan Care and asked about my check for taxes. They were going to look into it and get back to me. I again called before the first of the year and they told me they were waiting to receive the tax bill from my municipality Treasurer. I spoke with him and he said that was not a true statement and I was the only person they send the bill to. I again called them and they again said they would look into it and get back to me. Again, they never got back to me. I called after the first of the year to get the same song and dance from them. This time I wrote down the persons contact number and she said I had to send a request to change my escrow because it was marked to be paid to me XX/XX/XXXX. I talked to my mortgage lender that I does my financing and he said in his 20+ years he has NEVER checked box XXXX to have anyone 's escrow paid in XX/XX/XXXX and they were lying with the statement they gave me. I did send the email requesting they change my escrow to be paid to me in XX/XX/XXXX and I have a copy of it. They were to get back to me and of course they did not. 
I filed a complaint with the XXXX on this company and I was told that they would respond again within 10 days, that was now over three weeks ago and I have not heard a word from anyone. After talking with an attorney, I was recommended to contact you about my situation. My mortgage lender told me he was getting several complaints from others who had the same issues with the same company "" Loan Care ''. 
I have busted my XXXX to maintain a perfect credit rating even with the divorce I went through three years ago. I had to personally pay nearly {$3000.00} in taxes out of my savings to avoid being delinquent this year. I have still not received a phone call or a check from Loan Care and they also have my insurance in escrow so I can just imagine how that is going to play out next month. I hope you can go after these people and fine the XXXX out them for what they are doing to the consumer. Please help me get my money back from them and I hope you can put an end to their unethical practices!

8610,2015-04-15,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"I had a Shell Credit Card account for decades. The issuer is Citibank. The card was very seldom used, usually on long trips. At some point I believe late XX/XX/XXXX or early XXXX the account number was changed by Citibank and I do n't why. After that point it seems all communication, statements etc., stopped. Not using the card very often it did not come to my attention. In XX/XX/XXXX I used the Shell card to make a purchase in XXXX Ca. for XXXX. I am a person that pays his bills within a day or XXXX of receiving them. Something had happened to cause me to stop receiving statements from Shell/Citibank. Without a statement the purchase went unpaid. I believe that each month Citibank thought I was receiving statements and ignoring them so they added late charges until they closed the account and sent it to collections. Also, they notified the credit reporting agencies, showing a charge off on my report. I discovered all of this when I applied for a credit offer from a retail store. Prior to this point I did receive a letter from the collection agency indicating the charge off from my Shell account. Believing that I had a XXXX balance, I logged into my Shell account on-line and it shows no balance owed. I hought the letter was a fraud scheme. I can still log into the account. I discovered that I am logging into the old account number?? 
The action I have taken : Called the Citibank service center and asked to discuss my bill with the representative, who claimed she could not see the account since it was closed. She told me she would send the statements and I should try to figure out what happened. Really? 
Month later, received statements and discovered the aforementioned information so I called the Citibank service center again to discuss the issue. I was told this time that I would have to write a letter to the CBR Dispute Dept. of Citibank. 
Wrote letter to CBR Dispute Dept. outlining the details and asking for a representative to contact me with a resolution. They have not contacted me after sending additional faxes requesting any type of contact at all. 
After a month of no contact I emailed a letter to the CEO of Shell and the CEO of Citibank detailing the issue and begging for a representative from either company to contact me. 

I am a XXXX retired XXXX XXXX that takes pride in having a pristine credit report and have never paid a bill late. Please help me!

Our house burned down XX/XX/2014 and New American Funding has been managing the insurance settlement funds as I had a loan against the house that burned down. We had problems getting them to disperse these funds before and I was given a direct contact who was supposed to assist us with all future disbursements named XXXX but when I called to speak to him he was no longer with the company and I was told anyone could help me. I asked for a final inspection and it showed the house was complete. This inspection was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested the final draw amount and sent the letter via fax and mail they required, which was a document stating the repairs were complete, signed by me. I spoke with XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and she reiterated all they needed was the signed statement that the repairs were completed the completed inspection and that they would then be able to disperse the final draw. I received a letter XX/XX/XXXX stating they also needed a copy of the final bill from my builder. This was a news to me and so frustrating. Why do they keep adding requirements and not telling me in advance? The final bill from the builder had not yet been generated as we had a few outstanding change orders for some small landscaping issues. Furthermore what difference does it make if I owe more or less than whats in escrow? If its less does that make me less entitled to the funds? If I owe more does that mean I ca n't have the funds to pay the builder a partial payment? I was so frustrated with New American Funding that we decided to refinance the house with another company and I knew we were closing on that loan on XX/XX/XXXX with it scheduled to be funded XX/XX/XXXX so I opted to not send any additional documents as once the house was refinanced New American Funding no longer has any financial interest in my house or insurance money and would have to release the insurance settlement money. The loan I had at XXXX XXXX XXXX was paid off by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I called XX/XX/XXXX to confirm the funds were being sent and spoke to XXXX XXXX at the call center at around XXXX. He acknowledged that the loan was paid in full but that I had to send the final bill from my builder. I asked to speak to a supervisor was told they were not available after holding for about 20 mins, that it would be 48 hours before they could call back meaning Monday. XXXX then said they never even received a request for the final draw. I asked why they sent those forms and requests and he did n't seem to have an answer. He said he could resend the request but without the bill the file is not complete and the request would be denied.

8620,2016-01-05,Bank account or service,Checking account,Using a debit or ATM card,,"XX/XX/2015 I traveled to California. I noticed early Sunday morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that many fraudulent charges were made to my account. I tried to immediately notify Bank of America. They were closed so I had to wait a few hours until their fraud department opened. Once I reached them, the agent indicated that I had to wait for all of the pending and incoming transactions to actually clear before they could help me. So once they cleared, I had to call back again and get their assistance. 
It took a few days, but Bof A returned my money. I thought it was resolved. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Bof A began taking my money out again. I called and after speaking with XXXX agents I was told that my claim was denied. I was told that BofA had written proof from each merchant that I made the purchases. The "" proof '' indicated was my full address. 

Many of the charges are obvious - large sums of cash, the purchase of XXXX cell phones from different companies ( neither my current provider ), and multiple calls to a correctional facility. There was also an initial charge to XXXX a company that can pull all of my vital information ( address, birthday, email address, phone number ) which happen to be the items Bank of America claims they verified with the individual merchants ; this is the basis of their denial of my claim. 

I started contacting each merchant. Based on the limited information from my bank statement, the same limited information that Bank of America has, they can not find any evidence of the transactions ; which refutes Bank of America 's claim that they were able to prove that I made these purchases. If I ca n't get to who used my card and my own information, then how can Bank of America deny my claim based on that supposed information? 

I have now spoken with XXXX agents regarding this incident and have yet to be returned my {$1800.00}.

In the notice I was provided with a name and address of the new servicer and it was further stated in the notice that the old servicer would no longer accept payments on my loan. I was not provided with an account or loan number with the new servicer to associate my payment with and I was not contacted by the new servicer prior to my next payment being due. The old servicer pulled my payment automatically out of my bank account on the due date and therefore I am left with less than 15 days to attempt to get a check out to a new address via snail mail with no account number to apply it to. 

I know that as a consumer I have rights regarding the sale of servicing rights of mortgage loans. In particular I have the right to m notification by both parties with a 15 day minimum. 

My concern is that everything in terms of late fees, default interest rates and the benefit of legal advantage to be gained by the new servicer in creating confusion, not following the law and providing documents and notice verifying and reconciling the sale of servicing rights, address, account numbers and pertinent information so business can resume seamlessly and transparently. Large corporations have the advantage because it is them vs. all of the consumers individually. It 's like a mouse trying to defend itself against a lion and all of the lions lawyers. They have everything to gain by taking advantage and claiming that they are just clumsy at handling their XXXX dollar business. They will get only a slap on the hand and only that if one of the people they are taking advantage of has the resources to call them out and bring a law suit and win against their legal team at that. 
Also, it 's hard to tell if this whole loan servicing change is n't some sort of scam to hijack a massive number of loan payments by some criminal, cash a bunch of checks in a makeshift office and retire somewhere off the map. In any case, the least likely people to suffer any damage in any of this is the old servicer and the new servicer, where all of the risk involved falls directly on the consumer. Further, the name of the new servicer is completely unknown to my bank and has no credible presence on the Internet. Actually on the contrary. When you type their name into XXXX all you see is link after link of horror stories about them.

When I had a ratified sales contract and the loan was processing, few questions came up regarding a property I had in the past. Navy Federal delayed my process for about two weeks and all they said was "" we are verifying information '' finally we were a week from closing and since we were n't getting any response I had to get my nephew involved. My nephew used to work a t NFCU and he was the person that referred me to them so I gave him permission to speak on my behalf and try to find out what the issue was. He was not getting a response from processing so he provided us with a few emails from the company 's executives. Finally my nephew spoke to XXXX XXXX who asked if we had had a property in the past which was odd because I had been told by the processor during the process of the mortgage that XXXX XXXX was incorrectly reporting information about my social # so obviously we had a property in the past, it was on the credit report. XXXX then asked the disposition of the property and my nephew told her it had been sold as a short sale around XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX ( did n't have the exact date at that time ) but knew that our waiting period had definitely already past. XXXX then told us that the credit bureaus were not reporting accounts that I previously had in the past. WE asked her several times to please assist and let us know what accounts she was referring to but all XXXX said is to call the Bureaus. From the beginning of the application process, we had explained NFCU that I had been in this country for about XXXX years and paid taxes every year under my TAX ID and recently had obtained my green card and social security ( not sure why this was a surprise later on ). Called all XXXX credit bureaus and were told that the information they had was correct, we even uploaded a copy of our green cards/social security cards to verify our identities. XXXX refused to move our file along because she stated NFCU did not have a "" true '' FICO. We explained to XXXX we do not control nor have ANY WAY of manipulating the credit reports, we had call all XXXX Bureaus and asked to update any accounts under our tax XXXX if any and they stated the credit bureaus do not only report information based on SSN but also based on address, dob and names. At this point after several weeks of trying to get the matter resolved and a few days from our closing date, XXXX asked to call the Bureaus ONE more time and get the employee XXXX that we spoke to and requested the information to be updated. ONce again we called and gave XXXX this info- XXXX XXXX employee ID XXXX, XXXX XXXX employee ID XXXX and unfortunately XXXX did not want to give out this info, at the same time we again explained XXXX that all XXXX bureaus were saying the exact same thing NOTHING TO UPDATE, she refused to help us with putting us in touch with a department in any of the bureaus that will assist us with getting this fixed. The bureaus also agreed with us that we HAD NO power to manipulate any of this, if that is what NFCU was thinking. After all the hope XXXX XXXX had given us and made us go through, NFCU DENIED the loan on basis of "" unverifiable information '', we feel that this does not meet a true denial of a loan. We had provided ALL documentation requested, transcripts, bank staements, IDs, green cards, SSN cards, XXXX, pay stubs, rental information etc and all these documents are 100 % verifiable. We are still fighting to get our earnest money deposit from the seller and were put in a position with our landlord since we had to stay in the property after all.

They noted this on my account and assured me that there would be no problem. In XXXX 2016 ( mid-way through my stay ), Santander made a decision to de-activate my debit card as a new one, with a new chip, had been sent to my home and had been activated by the bank. I received no notice that the card I had with me would be de-activated. So, basically, Santander Bank is holding my funds hostage while I am in another country, unable to get the card that is sitting in a pile of mail at home. I have spoken with numerous representatives trying to get help and the answers have been the same ... so sorry ... .nothing we can do ... .the new cards were machine generated ... .the card you have with you can not be reactivated ( exp. date XX/XX/XXXX ) etc. I am trying to figure out a way to get cash. I can not believe that Santander activated a new card and deactivated the card I currently have with no notice or input from me. I thought it was up to the consumer to activate a new card. The fact that Santander is unwilling to even try to help me is unacceptable. I am sure that I am not the only consumer who has been left stranded without access to their funds while out of the country. How could this possible be legal????

In our research we found that XXXX could give us a brand new kitchen for XXXX less. When we asked Home Depot to price match they refused.

XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that I still owed interest on the {$15000.00}. I have made several attempted to get Home Depot Credit Services to remove the {$3800.00} in interest charges from my account, but they keep telling me that will only do that if I pay {$4800.00}. This does not make any sense to me as a consumer. No work was done by Home Depot at my except for the measuring of my existing cabinets for the task that was never completed. For two years my statements from Home Depot never showed a balance over {$8000.00}. Then all of a sudden a balance that was at {$5000.00} jumped to {$8800.00} without any explanation. Home Depot Credit Services and Home Depot have refused to answer questions from my legal assistance lawyers or respond back to me in writing as to how they came up with the {$3800.00} in interest charges on {$15000.00} charge that was removed from my account.

At that time since I was given a XXXX ARM loan and the XXXX loan was a Line of Credit. After XXXX years I went back to Wells Fargo and asked them if they will allow me to have a 30 year loan so atleast XXXX years from the date of initial purchase and when I am XXXX years old the house will be atleast fully paid off and be mine completely. They sent me back saying you do not have enough savings, this loan is a different kind of loan that can not be refinanced. 

After that every year I have been approaching Wells Fargo to get me into a 30 year fixed interest loan they send me back with some reason or the other. 

This year I applied for a 15 year loan and I was again denied this time saying I do not have cash in my savings and checking account. 

The condo is worth {$680000.00} now according to XXXX ( which does not include the {$30000.00} of upgrades ). I owe about {$420000.00} to Wells Fargo today, started with {$490000.00} a decade ago. In XXXX years I have paid atleast {$200000.00} in interest to Wells Fargo. Have not missed a single payment ever. My annual salary is about XXXX now. I have about XXXX in my 401K. Still they denied me the 15 year mortgage and now I read in the papers that the interest rate is going up so the rate I was told I could have by Wells Fargo intially will not apply. So no way to own my house and in the future if I get a loan I will have to pay even a higher interest amount to Wells Fargo. 

It is Wells Fargo win win all the way. Even after me being a loyal customer, never missing a payment for more than a decade I can not still have a 15 year fixed mortgage loan on my house. 

Please help me CFPB. And thank you for listening to this plea.

8882,2015-05-28,Bank account or service,(CD) Certificate of deposit,Deposits and withdrawals,,"It has taken almost 3 months for my IRA CD account at Discover Bank to be transferred to the Government Thrift Saving Plan. During this period I was assesed an Early Withdrawal penalty by the Bank. I disagree that what I did was early and that I made a withdrawal, so I believe no penalty should have been assesed. 1. Early - Section XXXX of Discover 's XXXX Account Agreement defines a list of terms. Early is not among the terms defined, so I had to settle for the definition of "" early '' in XXXX. The dictionary defines early as "" of, relating to, or occurring near the beginning of a period of time ... '' According to Discover 's web site, my CDs were opened between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( 3 to 5 years ago ), rolled over more than once, and have each retained the same CD identification number assigned at the original purchase. In such a case, one would think the period from purchase until the latest rollover would be considered "" early ''. After that rollover, we would be in the present eagerly anticipating the next ( future ) rollover. To characterize the current or next action upon something established years ago as early indicates confusion with the concept of past, present, and future and seems a misuse of the English language. 2. Withdrawal -. a. Below is a quote from Discover 's web site sales pitch for their IRA. Please note that when the funds are coming in it is labeled a transfer ( no mention of withdrawal ) "" With a transfer your money is moved directly from one IRA to another. The funds are exchanged between the financial institutions without the consumer ever handling them. "". b. Later on, when I questioned the "" early withdrawal penalty, '' I was informed by an IRA specialist, "" Any funds removed from an account are considered a withdrawal, in this case it was a withdrawal done via Transfer. Thus, per the Deposit Account Agreement, the Early Withdrawal Penalty does apply, and can not be waived. '' Other than the message above, I can not find any other reference to "" withdrawal done via Transfer '' in Discover 's literature or web site. In XXXX, above, Discover is quoted as stating that a transfer occurs between institutions, yet when I request a Transfer ( between institutions ) of the entire account, I am penalized for a withdrawal.. How can this be? c. Related to early withdrawal is the statement in Section XXXX ( Amendments, Account Changes and Notices, of Discover 's Deposit Account Agreement, "" If you are unwilling to agree to such amendments, you have the right to close your Account prior to the changes taking effect, subject to any Early Withdrawal Penalties. '' As I was/am willing to agree to the amendments and requested the IRA transfer subsequent to the Discover changes, I should not be subject to any early withdrawal penalties and my money restored. 3. Penalty - As it has taken Discover from XXXX until the XXXX to transfer my IRA account, I believe Discover has demonstrated outstanding proficiency in the subject of "" lateness/late ''. Unfortunately, I do not believe it has demonstrated any aptitude in "" early '' that would qualify it to assign penalties.
